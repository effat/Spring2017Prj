WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your browser as you surf
the web. Their purpose is to carry bits of useful information about your
interaction with the website that sets them.

Contrary to a common belief, cookies do not contain software programs, so cannot
install anything on a computer. 

Cookies generally do not contain any information that would identify a person.
Usually they contain a string of text or ""unique identifier"". This acts like a
label. When a website sees the string of text it set in a cookie, it knows the
browser is one it has seen before.

If you use a different computer, open a new web browser or delete your cookies,
the website will treat you as if you have arrived for the first time (and a new
cookie will be set).

WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?
Cookies can be used for a variety of reasons:

- to help remember your preferences on a site
(whether you read the oldest or newest comments first; the volume on the video
player)

- to understand how you and other users are using the site
(to tell what the most popular news story of the day is; to record how you
responded to a new design or version of the site)

- for logging in to a service or to make sure you're logged in securely
(these cookies may contain information such as your email address and your name
– the information you gave when you signed up. The website you signed up to is
the only site that can access this information.)

The cookies that appear to cause the most controversy, however, are for managing
the advertising you see on a website.

This is particularly the case when websites set a cookie from a separate
advertising delivery company. This cookie can record when and where you saw an
advert, where in the world you might have been when it happened and whether you
clicked on it.

The cookie will send this information to the cookie owner, who records this data
and uses it to make sure you don't see the same advert too many times.

If websites choose to pool some of the information this type of cookie collects
as part of an ad network, the systems used by advertising delivery companies can
create ""segments"" of browsers that display similar behaviours. 

They will use this to try to draw conclusions about what the people behind the
browsers might be interested in: ""basketball lovers"" or ""hair product
enthusiasts"" or ""adventure holiday takers"", for example. Cookies that do this
are known as third-party advertising cookies.

Over time they learn which types of adverts are most effective to these groups
and can sell this service to advertisers.

HOW DO I CONTROL COOKIES?
Although much of the public concern around cookies would suggest otherwise, they
can be controlled if you know how:

You can set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing (Find
out more for FireFox [http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Deleting%20cookies], 
Internet Explorer [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835], Chrome
[https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647&p=cpn_cookies]
, Safari [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Safari/3.0/en/11471.html]
). 

If you don't delete cookies, you can set ""opt out"" cookies on your browser. Each
type of tracker will usually have an opt-out. Evidon – a company that monitors
what trackers get used by websites – has aggregated many of them together on its 
opt-out page [http://www.evidon.com/consumers/profile_manager#tab3]. 

OTHER FORMS OF WEB TRACKING:
Cookies are the most well-known form of online tracking, but there are many
other ways that companies may use to track browsing behaviour on websites. These
include:

Flash cookies: also known at ""locally shared objects"". These are pieces of
information that Adobe Flash might store on your computer. This is designed to
save data such as video volume preferences or, perhaps, your scores in an online
game.

Flash cookies have caused controversy because they can not be deleted in the
same way as other cookies. This has meant that some less scrupulous companies
have used them as ""cookie backups"", loading a traditional cookie back into your
computer if you delete it. You can control what sites store information on 
Adobe's website
[http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html#118539]
.

Server logs: when you load a page on a website, you are making a request to that
website's server. This server will log the type of request that was made and
will store information such as: IP address (which will allow website owners to
infer location), the date and time the browser loaded the page, what page was
loaded, and what site or page the browser was on before it came to that page
(referrer).

Server logs form the basis for web analytics and can only be seen by the owners
of the website.

Web beacons: these are small objects embedded into a web page, but are not
visible. They can also be known as ""tags"", ""tracking bugs"", ""pixel trackers"" or
""pixel gifs"".

A simple version of this is a tiny clear image that is the size of a pixel. When
a web page with this image loads, it will make a call to a server for the image.
This ""server call"" allows companies to know that someone has loaded the page. 

This is very useful to companies that want to learn if readers are opening their
the emails they send. When the web beacon loads, companies can tell who opened
the email and when. 

This system has been abused by spammers who will identify active email accounts
by sending emails that include pixel trackers. This is why many email systems
will ask if you trust the sender before it displays images.

Web beacons are not as useful to website owners who already have access to their
server logs. However, they are useful to advertisers displaying their ads on
someone else's website or services that don't have server log access. Often
advertisers will embed web beacons in their adverts to get an idea of how often
an advert is appearing.

"technology/2012/apr/23/scorecardresearch-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS SCORECARDRESEARCH?
ScorecardResearch [http://www.scorecardresearch.com/About.aspx] is part of a
company called Full Circle Studies [http://www.fullcirclestudies.com/Home.aspx],
which is owned by comScore [http://www.comscore.com/].

To put the size of comScore into some context, its factsheet
[http://www.comscore.com/About_comScore/comScore_Fact_Sheet] claims it tracks
more than three million unique websites worldwide and its methodology page says
it has ""approximately two million worldwide consumers under continuous
measurement [http://www.comscore.com/About_comScore/Methodology]"".

It provides market research data to website owners through a mixture of online
surveys and the use of web beacons
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/cookies-and-web-tracking-intro]
.

According to comScore, websites elect to take part in the company's market
research. The website owners place ScorecardResearch web beacons into the pages
of their website. 

When a browser loads a page that contains a ScorecardResearch web beacon, a
cookie will be set. This, says comScore, allows it to observe ""browser-level""
behaviour, i.e. how often you return to a website or if, having visited one
website, you go to another one that is related.

The data that is collected is used to build up reports on internet behaviour and
trends. 

WHAT INFORMATION IS SCORECARD RESEARCH TRACKING? 
ScorecardResearch's privacy policy says its tracking will collect information
such as:
- when your browser visited a website
- what page of the website it was
- the title of the web page 
- IP address

If you elect to answer a ScorecardResearch survey, this may also be logged (so
you are not shown the same survey again).

Is the data ever matched to personally identifiable information?
As with all cookies and web beacons, ScorecardResearch cannot identify an
individual user who is using the computer to visit a website that contains a
ScorecardResearch tag.

However, the cookie may be used to observe certain types of browsing behaviours,
which are then combined with other browser data to give a picture of what people
are likely to do when they surf the web.

What other ways does Scorecard Research track? What information?
ComScore uses web beacons and cookies for other products in a similar way to
ScoreCard Research. It's worth noting that comScore has a lot of products and
services focused on digital audiences
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/cookies-and-web-tracking-intro]
.

HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED FOR?
The data obtained through ScorecardResearch cookies is kept for up to 90 days.
When it is aggregated to observe trends, it may be used for analytical purposes
indefinitely. 

If a particular site asks for detailed research about a topic, comScore says
""selected anonymous records relating to that specific site may be maintained
indefinitely"".

WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT DATA IS DELETED?
ScorecardResearch, like many third-party cookie operators, has its privacy
policy vetted by TRUSTe
[http://www.truste.com/products-and-services/enterprise_privacy/web_privacy_seal]
.

TRUSTe checks to see if ScorecardResearch does everything it says it does in its
privacy policy. If it does, it gets a seal. It does not mean it is following any
particular industry standard for privacy (except the one it holds for itself).

A standard it does adhere to is the International Safe Harbor privacy principles
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles].

HOW IS THE DATA USED? IS THE DATA SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES?
""The information is analysed and the resulting reports are shared with our
clients,"" says comScore. 

These reports aim to help companies understand internet behaviour. Some of the
more general ones are presented publicly
[http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases], such as a report about
the effectiveness of pharmaceutical marketing
[http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/4/Branded_Pharmaceutical_Websites_Continue_to_Generate_Highest_Lifts] 
or how popular sports content is in Europe
[http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/4/Nearly_Half_of_European_Online_Audience_Visit_Sports_Sites]
.

DO YOUR COOKIES CIRCUMVENT PRIVACY-ENHANCING SOFTWARE, SUCH AS TOR?
No, says comScore.

"technology/2012/apr/23/quantcast-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS QUANTSERVE?
Quantserve.com creates web beacons and cookies operated by audience research and
behavioural advertising company Quantcast [http://www.quantcast.com/]. 

It has a number of products
[http://www.quantcast.com/learning-center/videos/what-is-quantcast]:

Measurement & Insight
This service allows website owners and advertisers can use Quantcast web beacons
in their content to see how many views they get, what age range the people
viewing are likely to be in, and what income they are likely to generate
(demographic data). 

Audience Targeting
Quantcast uses the measurement and insight data help companies find people to
target with their advertising. Their ""Quantcast Lookalikes"" service lets website
owners build their own audience segments, which can be very specific. For
example, a company could build a behavioural profile of the type of person that
likes buying a particular product from their website. Quantcast would then
identify other browsers that are similar so adverts for that product could be
targeted to them. 

WHAT INFORMATION IS QUANTCAST TRACKING?
Quantcast says all its tracking is anonymous, accessing when, from where and at
what time a browser loads its web beacon. ""Quantcast only models anonymous
records of internet usage. Quantcast does not intentionally collect any
personally identifiable information – that is, information that could be used to
uniquely identify or locate an individual.""

On its website, Quantcast says it uses statistical modelling to ""build a
translation of cookies to people"". Part of the aim of this approach is to
counteract the issue that some people who access sites on multiple devices, or
delete cookies regularly, may be counted more than once.

Quantcast say it does this by looking at patterns such as how often browsers are
visiting the site, and how often they are likely to visit at home and work to
infer how many ""real"" people are accessing a website
[http://www.quantcast.com/how-we-do-it/methodology]. 

However, it does not obtain information that relates back to specific
individuals. What Quantcast does is build up a profile of a browser's behaviour
across all sites using their web beacons (it claims these include over ""100m web
destinations, including websites, video, widgets, blogs, and advertising
campaigns"").

Information that may be captured when browsing a site using Quantcast includes:
what page the browser was on; what searches were typed into the website search;
the time the browser was on the website. This information, or ""log data"", is
then used to build a profile of different types or ""segments"" of browsers.

In 2010, Quantcast paid $2.4m to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it used
Flash cookies to reset tracking cookies
[http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/zombie-cookie-settlement/] after users
deleted them. The firm stopped using Flash cookies in 2009, after research by
The University of California Berkley identified the practice and it was 
publicised in the media
[http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/flash-cookie-researchers-spark-quantcast-change/]
.

IS THE DATA SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES?
In its privacy policy, Quantcast says it may share log data and aggregated
information with third parties. These include:
- companies employed to support Quantcast services.
- companies that provide delivery and measurement of ad campaigns.

This data would be used for such things as industry analysis and targeting
adverts.

HOW MUCH MONEY DOES QUANTCAST MAKE?
Quantcast is a private US company so is not obliged to publish detailed
breakdowns of its revenue and profit. However, the company does say it is backed
by over $50m in funding from the following investors: Allen & Company, Cisco
Systems, Founders Fund, Polaris Venture Partners and Revolution Ventures

"technology/2012/apr/23/facebook-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS FACEBOOK.COM?
This question doesn't really need answering, but what is interesting is how this
social network uses cookies on other websites – especially if you do not have a
Facebook account.

WHAT INFORMATION IS FACEBOOK.COM TRACKING?
The Facebook tracker that appears in our data is not for targeted advertising.
In fact, Facebook explicitly told us it has no need for such a thing – the
information its users willingly volunteer on the platform is a far richer
resource for advertising.

The tracker we are seeing in our data is, most likely, from Facebook's ""social
plugins [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/]"". These are tools that
link back to Facebook in some way, such as the ""like"", subscribe"" or ""recommend""
buttons.

They appear on other websites through the use of ""iframes"", a very common way of
embedding content on to a web page. In order for this to load, Facebook's
servers will know the page, the time and date it was loaded and the browser IP
address.

According to the December 2011 Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) audit
[http://dataprotection.ie/documents/facebook%20report/final%20report/report.pdf] 
(PDF) of Facebook, the cookies that are set and the data required by these
plugins can differ.

If you do not have a Facebook account and your browser has loaded a facebook.com
page, then no cookie is set when you browse a page with social plugins. 

If you do not have a Facebook account but your browser has visited a
facebook.com page in the past, three cookies would have already been set on your
browser. One is for security purposes and the other two are used to track
registration effectiveness. If a user later decides to create an account, the
aim is to find out what convinced them to do it. This is done by recording the
first and last Facebook pages the browser visited.

If you have a Facebook account, you will have a cookie set on your browser
containing a unique ID that relates back to your profile. If you have checked
""keep me logged in"", the cookie will also record this.

When you visit a page with a social plugin, it will check that cookie
[https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=206635839404055#Does-Facebook-receive-cookie-information-when-I-visit-a-site-with-the-Like-button-or-another-social-plugin?]
. If you are signed in, it will use your unique ID to show you how many of your
friends have clicked on the like button and whether or not you have liked the
page yourself.

Controversy erupted late last year around this cookie, as it was discovered that
a user's unique ID was not deleted when they signed out of Facebook
[http://betanews.com/2011/09/28/facebook-backs-off-tracking-logged-out-users/] 
and so could be read when a page with social plugins was loaded. Facebook says
this has now been changed.

IS THE DATA EVER MATCHED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
If you click on a Facebook ""like"" or ""share"" button, this is displayed on your
Facebook wall. In order to do this, Facebook has to match this action with your
account details. This is done through the log-in cookie.

HOW IS THE DATA USED? IS THE DATA SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES?
Information about the social plugins you have clicked will be shown to your
friends, both on Facebook or on the site that you clicked the button on. In its 
video introduction to social plugins
[https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=103828869708800#What-are-social-plugins?] 
Facebook says this is not shared with anyone else.

Facebook say your information is not shared with third parties. If you add
content to Facebook, you own the data.

Due to concerns that Facebook may be using social plugins to influence its
advert targeting, the Irish DPC tested web pages [http://bit.ly/HW3qy1] (PDF)
with ""like"" or ""share"" buttons on them (p184-185). It concluded:

- Browsing websites that had share buttons did not appear to influence the
advertising targeted at a user. 
- Pressing the ""like"" button either on a Facebook page or on a page with a
social plugin may 
influence the advertising targeted at the user.
- The advertising targeting appears to be focused on particular Facebook pages
and/or very 
specific keywords.
- Browsing to a category of websites or interests (e.g. ""parenting/childcare"" or
""motorcycles"") did not appear to have any influence on the advertising targeted
at a user.

WHAT OTHER WAYS DOES FACEBOOK TRACK? WHAT INFORMATION?
Facebook lists all the ways it receives information about users in its Data Use
Policy [https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#inforeceived ].

HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED FOR ON FACEBOOK'S SERVERS AND ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S
BROWSER?
Data associated with your Facebook account is stored for as long as that account
is active. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook.
It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information
may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days
[https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info#deleting]. 

Can Facebook give one example of how tracking genuinely benefits the people
being tracked?
""We don't track people"", says Facebook, adding that cookies are useful for:

- Security and site integrity.
- Optimising the way a Facebook page displays in your browser [by storing
browser window dimensions].
- Enabling a user to stay logged-in on a device they use frequently, such as a
home computer.
- Making it easy for users to sign in to Facebook – for example, by auto-filling
the email field of the login form.
- Recognising when a person is accessing Facebook from an unfamiliar device –
this then enables additional security features.

"technology/2008/apr/03/privacy.apple","Call it a Clay Shirky moment. He, you'll recall, is the author of Here Comes
Everybody, the book about how we can come together from the disorganised chaos
of the net to produce effective groups to get things done. One example is the
revolt over the proposals by Phorm, the would-be targeted advertising company,
to get BT, Virgin Media and Talk Talk to turn their customers over to them. The
questions, and the information, kept coming. Talk Talk announced that use would
be opt-in, not opt-out. There is more to come; but that hasn't stopped Phorm
[http://www.tinyurl.com/2u5xes] from hiring not one, not two, but three
organisations to do its PR.

Yet when one of the people at the three ISPs asked me what I thought Phorm
should do to fight all the negative PR out there, the answer seemed simple
enough: make all the plans available online so everyone can pick over them. (A
version of the presentation to BT is already at The Register
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/].) If there's no invasion of privacy, it'll be
clear enough.

Next up is Apple. Yes, the company that likes to say ... nothing, though as
we've already seen, that actually has the effect of making people more
interested (Why Apple's secretive approach is so effective
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/21/apple.marketingandpr],
February 21). But sometimes, saying nothing isn't enough. Take the case of the
cracking MacBooks, a cosmetic problem that has affected an indeterminate number
of Apple's low-end laptops. Occasionally the casing - usually, though not
always, on the lower right-hand side - develops a crack in which small strips at
the edge separate or even break off. Often this happens after the 12-month
warranty has expired. 

An obvious question: what's under the lower right-hand side? After all, that
might hold some part of the explanation, mightn't it? I sent Apple's PR a set of
questions - was the cracking a known problem? And what's down there?

Apple's response? ""If a customer experiences an issue with their MacBook they
should contact AppleCare."" (This applies apparently whether or not you've paid
for the aftercare service.) But it doesn't explain what might be the cause of
the problem. I asked again for clarification; there was no reply by press time.

But never fear: on the net, someone has the information you want. Search for
""MacBook disassembly"" and you alight on ifixit.com [http://www.ifixit.com]'s
guide to taking to pieces pretty much anything Apple-y. Choose how to (say)
repair the right-hand speaker, and it shows you how to remove the top of the
system. And there it is: underneath the front right-hand side of the keyboard is
the hard drive. We might guess that the hard drive, since it spins a lot, warms
up the plastic at the front of the casing and, through thermal cycling (warming
up when the drive is spinning, cooling down when it sleeps, warming up when it
spins again) starts to show cracks. See, that wasn't so hard, was it? 

What these two examples show so starkly, though, is how difficult it is to run
formal organisations nowadays. The internet has democratised criticism -
particularly the informed variety. You may not know what the structures under
Apple's MacBook or Phorm's server-sniffing are, but we can find people who take
structures apart, others who know about plastics deformation, others who know
about IP networks.

As Shirky pointed out, ground-up organisation is easy now; it's only finding the
levers to pull that's tricky. It's relatively easy with businesses, though,
because annoying (would be) customers is not a good way to stay in profit.

In Phorm's case, it might even make it hard to stay in business. It's a high
price for not being open - but that's the price the internet exacts nowadays.","Technology","2008-04-02T23:05:46Z","Charles Arthur: Come out, Phorm and Apple, we're here to criticise you","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/03/privacy.apple"
"technology/blog/2008/apr/08/cambridgeexpertusesafarito","We've noted previously
[http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/2008/04/06/cambridge_researcher_looks_into_phorm.html] 
how Richard Clayton had a detailed presentation from Phorm, the server-side
adware company that is in talks with BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk to provide
its systems.

In an exclusive interview on the Guardian's latest Tech Weekly podcast (),
Clayton explained that - through a strange quirk - Apple's Safari browser
doesn't play ball with the Phorm system, because of the way that the Phorm
system passes cookies (it's surprisingly complex; see his PDF writeup) between
itself and originating sites.

Bad news: if you're using Internet Explorer or Firefox, you'll get tracked - or
as Clayton puts it, ""they will intercept your traffic and snoop on it."" But, he
added, ""if a [web page] request does not appear to have been generated by a
""well-known"" browser, then the request will be ignored [by Phorm's system inside
the ISP's system]."" Explaining this in an interview with the Guardian's Tech
Weekly podcast, Clayton said that this was because many other processes, such as
software update checks, can go via port 80, the web browsing channel that Phorm
inspects. Dipping into those streams might cause problems. ""So they've
concentrated on traffic just from browsers where they understand what will
happen.""

But Safari treats cookies differently, he said. ""As far as I can see it's not
that that they can't [track users on it] but in practice Safari has some
built-in settings which mean that the cookies that they rely on at the end of
the process [where you request a page, Phorm inspects it for cookies and whether
to serve an ad and passes back a cookie] to serve you up targeted ads will not
be sent by Safari because it considers it a privacy risk and doesn't send the
cookies.""

Other points arising from the interview, in which the topic of the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) 2000, governing snooping on internet traffic, is
mentioned a lot:

 * Gmail is legal [under Ripa] only because it's based in the US, not the UK.
   ""Gmail is sitting out in California and is a bit more tricky for UK
   legislation to cover it... If [they were based in the UK] they would have to
   concentrate quite carefully on exactly what they were doing and the extent to
   which they were parsing incoming email.""
 * BT could offer the anti-phishing system being touted as a major benefit of
   Phorm without using the Phorm system. ""If BT wanted to deploy an
   anti-phishing system they could do that without fluffing around with all the
   complexity in this system.""
 * if one person in a household which shares an internet connnection opts out,
   everyone is opted out of Phorm. But conversely, if one person opts in (even
   accidentally, say by clearing their cookies) then everyone is opted in.



Clayton reserved his greatest ire for BT, saying that the 2006 and 2007 trials
""absolutely"" breached the Ripa: ""because it can't even argue that they got
permission from the person who was sending the [web page] requests, so
essentially they've been snooping on this data. BT will doubtless say they
didn't look at this data, which seems an odd sort of trial... that seems to me
extremely wicked of BT. Whether they're going to go to jail for it, one leaves
to the courts, but it's not the sort of behaviour one expects from major public
- well, private - institutions.""

Phorm said today that narrow interpretations of Ripa like that would mean
systems such as Gmail or spam filtering would also be illegal. ""We conducted
extensive due diligence on the legality of our system under current interception
law,"" it said. These ""have led to only one conclusion — that Phorm's systems are
legal under any full interpretation of the law.""

We did ask BT to comment further last week, and to come in to the podcast to
explain BT's position. Its spokesman declined to offer anyone for interview.","Technology","2008-04-08T17:19:59Z","Cambridge expert: use Safari to evade Phorm","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/apr/08/cambridgeexpertusesafarito"
"technology/2008/apr/10/apple.privacy","Because the Safari browser treats cookies differently from Internet Explorer and
Firefox, says Dr Richard Clayton, a security researcher from Cambridge, after a
detailed briefing on the Phorm user- and ad-tracking system.

Privacy settings in Safari prevent Phorm's system of cookie identification, by
which it ""pretends"" to be the cookie's originating site, says Clayton. In a
writeup available on his team's lightbluetouchpaper.org
[http://www.tinyurl.com/5aqxf8] site, Clayton notes that ""if a [web page]
request does not appear to have been generated by a ""well-known"" browser, then
the request will be ignored [by Phorm's system inside the ISP's system].""
Explaining this in an interview with the Guardian's Tech Weekly podcast, Clayton
said that this was because many other processes, such as software update checks,
can go via port 80, the web browsing channel that Phorm inspects. Dipping into
those streams might cause problems. ""So they've concentrated on traffic just
from browsers where they understand what will happen. If you're using Internet
Explorer or Firefox, then they will intercept your traffic and snoop on it.""

Apple's Safari, though, ""has some built-in settings which means that the cookies
which [Phorm] rely on at the end of the process to serve you up targeted ads
will not be sent by Safari because it considers that a privacy risk and doesn't
send them"".

Clayton had other criticism for Phorm and for BT, which carried out two separate
trials of versions of the company's technology - affecting about 18,000 users in
each case - in 2006 and 2007. The Phorm system ""definitely"" invades privacy,
Clayton said, and is a prima facie breach of the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act (Ripa) 2000, which governs interception of communications. The
reason: because the websites have not necessarily agreed to have their content
interfered with as the Phorm system does.

Clayton reserved his greatest ire for BT, saying that the 2006 and 2007 trials
""absolutely"" breached the Ripa: ""because it can't even argue that they got
permission from the person who was sending the [web page] requests, so
essentially they've been snooping on this data. BT will doubtless say they
didn't look at this data, which seems an odd sort of trial ... that seems to me
extremely wicked of BT. Whether they're going to go to jail for it, one leaves
to the courts, but it's not the sort of behaviour one expects from major public

Phorm said that narrow interpretations of Ripa like that would mean systems such
as Google Mail or spam filtering would also be illegal. ""We conducted extensive
due diligence on the legality of our system under current interception law,"" it
said. These ""have led to only one conclusion - that Phorm's systems are legal

a photocopy of a BT Retail Technology memo. (Its authenticity remains
unconfirmed.)

Of 10,000 trial users, ""at least 15-20 separate users did detect the presence of
the system as evidenced from message board posts,"" says the memo. That's not
many, but it would imply more than 1,300 in the first two weeks of full-scale
operation.

The memo also warns:

Any deployment of PageSense will clearly require the user based to be informed.
Despite the fact that the system is intended to improve the relevance of
advertisements through anonymous collation of browsing histories, communications
regarding advertisement systems and information collection could lead to
negative perception if not carefully handled.

"technology/blog/2008/mar/17/fiprquerieslegalityofphorm","The Foundation for Internet Policy Research (FIPR) thinktank has criticised
[http://www.fipr.org/press/080317phorm.html] Phorm's plans to introduce systems
that will anonymise your browsing (if you're with BT or Virgin Media, or opt in
from TalkTalk) and serve you targeted ads plus warn you about known phishing
sites.

In its letter to the Information Commissioner
[http://www.fipr.org/080317icoletter.html], FIPR says that

Users are apparently to be allocated pseudonyms for some of the processing, but
at various processing stages the personal data can be linked to the pseudonym,
the pseudonym can be linked to the IP address used, and the IP address can be
linked to the user. Although we understand that this linkage will not be
standard operating practice, it can nevertheless be performed. 

Many users will also be identifiable from the content of the data scanned, since
it will include email sent or retrieved by users of web-based email, and
messages viewable by those authorised to gain access to individual pages of
social networking sites. 

Although some web-based email systems operate using ""https:"" end-to-end
encryption, which would prevent interception, this is far from ubiquitous. It
might be possible for Phorm to configure the service to exclude a handful of the
more high-profile web-mail and social networking systems. But there are no
available methods of detecting the tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of
other, low usage, often semi-private systems which currently provide web-mail or
social networking in chat rooms or similar environments. 

Classification by scanning in this way seems to us to be highly intrusive. We
think that it should not be undertaken without explicit consent from users who
have been given particularly clear information about what is liable to be
scanned. Users should have to opt in to such a system, not merely be given an
opportunity to opt out. We believe this is also required under European data
protection law; failure to establish a clear and transparent ""opt-in"" system is
likely to render the entire process illegal and open to challenge in UK and
European courts. 

This must be annoying for Phorm. In the meantime, we have asked the company for
sight of the report by 80/20, the private consultancy run by Simon Davies and
Gus Hosein (which Kent Ertegrul, chief executive of Phorm, mistook for Privacy
International in our interview). The company said earlier today (Monday) that it
would send it over - we haven't got it yet but expect to see it on Tuesday.
We'll keep you posted...","Technology","2008-03-17T22:47:46Z","FIPR queries legality of Phorm with Information Commissioner","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/mar/17/fiprquerieslegalityofphorm"
"technology/blog/2008/mar/18/phormsreportfrom8020readi","Since the whole thing about server-side adware company Phorm first blew up,
we've been hearing about the report by 80/20, a consultancy run by Simon Davies
and Gus Hosein (better known for their role in Privacy International), which
examined the implications of the Phorm setup. (Kent Ertegrul, Phorm's chief
executive, confused the two, very separate, organisations, as you'll recall from
our interview.)

Now we've been sent the report, dated February 10 2008, which you can download
[http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/Phorm%20PIA%20interim%20final%20.pdf] 
(PDF, 396KB). We've not had time to digest it at all, so we'll update this entry
as and when we get the chance. In the meantime, Phorm points out that this was
an interim report - the full one is due later this month (not much time for
that, then) and that while it has a number of queries, those are now being
sorted out with 80/20.

A couple of quick notes from the report:

This PIA [Privacy Impact Assessment] takes into account the May 2007 audit
performed by Ernst & Young. While broadly agreeing with Ernst & Young's
findings, the 80/20 assessment provides a broader geographical context, a wider
focus across a more universal privacy environment and a more risk-based approach
in its methodology. 

I can see which report we have to look at next...

From the executive summary:

We broadly agree with the positive findings of the 2007 Ernst & Young privacy
examination, but remain concerned that the scope of that report was based almost
exclusively on conditions applying to the US privacy environment. Public
sensitivities, regulatory conditions and other factors vary substantially
according to geographical location. 

We are encouraged by the spirit of openness shown by Phorm's executive team. A
clear willingness to engage with and respond to this examination has, in our
view, provided a strong foundation for development of a strong and sustainable
privacy commitment by the organisation. 

Based on the information and documentation we have reviewed, we believe that
Phorm Technology does not make use of personal data as defined in the UK Data
Protection Act (though not necessarily the data protection or privacy Acts of
all countries). However the technology may prompt wider (albeit often perception
based) privacy and intrusion concerns. 

Can't fault them on their foresight with the latter. Over to you: what's in
there?","Technology","2008-03-18T18:34:38Z","Phorm's report from 80/20: read it here","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/mar/18/phormsreportfrom8020readi"

He writes:

Will people please read our report to Phorm. Read it in its brief entirety
[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/PhormPIAinterimfinal.pdf]. [ Link
reinstated - CA 26/3/08] Once you'll do, you'll realise that there are no
conflicts whatever. In that report we argue that the system should be opt-in,
that there are unresolved questions, that the matter of legal compliance is
irrelevant to the issue of intrusion. For example, from page 10 of our PIA: 

""Phorm liaised with the Home Office to assess whether its system could infringe
the UK law that regulates communications surveillance. The Home Office concluded
that Phorm's system is consistent with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act and does not intercept communications. While this conclusion is a fair
interpretation of Phorm and the system's capabilities, communications monitoring
still takes place. Even if the Home Office's conclusions were appropriate and
relevant, it would mean that if an ISP or any government wished to conduct
similar monitoring of communications for segmentation purposes, albeit with
consent of the user, then they may indeed do so and yet still be compliant with
UK law. This could indeed give rise to a worrying situation."" 

Yes, FIPR has lodged a detailed complaint with the ICO. That complaint dealt
with matters outside 80/20s remit. There is no conflict there. Is there a
conflict between our role in PI and our role in 80/20? Absolutely not. See
above. My view is on the record at 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7280791.stm
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7280791.stm] Read beyond the headline. 

People have asked: ""Why are they doing this?"" ""Why are they advising the evil
empire?"" Two reasons. First, we believe that engagement is more constructive
than non-engagement unless there is no alternative. As PI we have directly
engaged companies such as SWIFT, Microsoft and eBay with positive results for
privacy. 

Second, the British Public, who apparently SO support PI, donate an average of
£130 a year to us. We receive more from citizens of India, even during the
height of the ID card battle. I, for one, haven't drawn a salary from PI for
eighteen years. That is not a sustainable situation. Nor is it for my staff. Our
supporters believe in an ideal, but some seem to believe we must be willing for
us to go to our graves principled but penniless. There is a Thatcherite
condition that prevails. Namely, that many supporters will make financial
contributions to people like us as long as they have some sort of formalised
stake in the enterprise. We never played that game. 

What is 80/20 Thinking? Check out www.8020thinking.com and find out the details.
Or go straight to http://www.8020thinking.com/ethics.html
[http://www.8020thinking.com/ethics.html] and you'll see that in fact this
company is very much in the advocacy realm, and is intentionally set up to
distribute fifty percent of its profits to NGO civil liberties campaigners in
developing countries. 

Please allow me the pleasure of a small personal reflection. It seems to me,
looking back over nearly two decades as an activist, that people were always
willing to hail me - and PI - as heroes and visionaries, on the strict condition
that we reflected everything without deviation or hesitation that they
personally believed. On CCTV, ID cards, children's fingerprinting, US relations,
police powers, DNA databases, going back further to the crypto wars and even
further back in dim history to CLI and the telephone battles of the early 1990s,
you were always there for us as long as we agreed with you on every point. 

So we disagree on one paragraph, namely, our point that personal information has
been removed from the Phorm system ""as defined in the UK DPA"". If you want to
demonise us for making that observation, then go ahead. At a personal level, I
find that level of aggression unnecessary. I understand you are concerned about
alleged endorsement, but let me reassure you that if we ever endorsed a product,
you'd know about it. The last time we endorsed anything was PGP in the era of
Phil Zimmermann. 

He then responds to ""reader queries"":

As I mentioned to Chris Williams of the Register, we did not initially make the
connection between Phorm and People on Page. I checked out the histories of all
the Phorm Directors and key staff, but failed to spot the PoP issue. This was
complicated by reporting that 121 Media had become a unit of a new holding
company (Phorm) - effectively making it a merger, rather than merely a name
change, as has recently been claimed 
http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2007/05/04/afx3685378.html
[http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2007/05/04/afx3685378.html] 
(Charles Arthur notes: while this is, I think, correct, Kent Ertegrul, chief
executive of Phorm, didn't describe it that way - he just called it ""a name
change"" in my interview with him
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2008/mar/11/charles.arthur.phorm].) 

Even so - and again, as I've also told the Register - I'm not entirely sure that
we'd have walked away even if we had made the connection between the two. Five
years ago we made conscious decision to lay down our guns and engage directly
with Microsoft (which was, remember, the evil empire back then). Now, five years
later, even Microsoft publicly acknowledges that our carrot and stick approach
has been of enormous value in re-positioning the company's approach to privacy. 

Interestingly, it was not until a couple of weeks after the Phorm announcement
in the press that people became aware of the 121 Media connection. As far as I
can see, one of Phorm's competitors tipped off the mainstream press and that's
how the wave started to break. It's also where I heard it first. 

And yes, I've engaged Phorm over all this. Why should they now be trusted? Well,
I'd question whether we should trust ""any"" organisation dealing with personal
data. It's more a case of whether you believe that their business is sustainable
the way they originally planned it. Right at the moment the opt-in model appears
to be more viable at a number of levels. 

As for FIPR, I never saw its complaint as relevant to our scope with Phorm and
so didn't advise on their complaint. I can't say one way or the other whether
the ISP's would be in breach of RIPA. Much depends on how they move forward from
this point.

In short, I think he's saying it's better to jaw jaw than to war war. Especially
when all the attrition seems to be to yourself, not the other side.","Technology","2008-03-20T22:50:12Z","Simon Davies (of Privacy International, and 80/20 Thinking) on Phorm","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/mar/20/simondaviesofprivacyintern"
"technology/2008/apr/03/privacy.telecoms","BT Broadband has admitted that it carried out secret trials on 18,000 user
accounts in autumn 2006 with technology from 121Media, which became the targeted
advertising company Phorm. Though BT has not yet said where the trials were
done, the systems were used to analyse web traffic and then serve selected
adverts on a number of selected websites.

The revelation, first detailed on The Register
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/01/bt_phorm_2006_trial/] website, might
lead to legal action by any of the users who can show their data was used. That
is because it appears to breach the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
(RIPA) 2000, which makes it an offence to intercept internet traffic without
consent or a warrant.

Phorm is negotiating a deal with BT, Virgin Media and Talk Talk, the UK's three
largest ISPs with about 10m users. It would analyse web browsing and offer
targeted adverts, as well as warning about phishing sites. Talk Talk has said it
will make the service opt-in; BT has implied it will be opt-out. Virgin Media
had no comment.

BT's 2006 trials certainly involved some sort of interception, because the data
streams had extra Javascript inserted into them - which puzzled a number of
people at the time. Two examples can be seen at the forums of raisingkids.co.uk
[http://www.tinyurl.com/2r9w2n] and progarchives.com
[http://www.tinyurl.com/3da9ws]. In both, the Javascript and other tags inserted
by the 121Media system are clearly visible, with one showing the referring page
and possibly ""interests"" of the member. Both contain links to sysip.net - the
121Media-owned site through which BT sent browser requests during the 2006
trials and later ones in summer 2007.

BT declined to comment beyond a prepared statement, saying: ""The purpose of the
test was to evaluate the functional and technical performance of the platform.
It is important for BT to ensure that before any new technologies are deployed,
they are robust and fit for purpose. No personally identifiable information was
processed, stored or disclosed during this test.""

But serious questions remain. BT said that the test was only carried out for two
weeks - yet the second forum posting above was made in December 2006.

Last week Guardian News and Media, which publishes the Guardian, announced that
it would not pursue any advertising tie-up with Phorm, after having initially
expressed an interest. ""We have concluded at this time that we do not want to be
part of the network,"" said Simon Kilby, GNM's advertising manager. ""Our decision
was in no small part down to the conversations we had internally about how this
product sits with the values of our company.""

Phorm says its technology means adverts can be better targeted to individuals,
by creating ""profiles"" of their browsing behaviour while not retaining any
personally identifiable information; users are identified by randomly-numbered
browser cookies, whose number matches to a profile on the Phorm system. Adverts
could be better targeted, and because it monitors the sites people visit, could
also warn users about known phishing sites.

Kilby's name as Philby. This has been corrected.","Technology","2008-04-03T16:02:10Z","BT admits tracking 18,000 users with Phorm systems in 2006","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/03/privacy.telecoms"
"technology/blog/2008/apr/10/roundingupallthephunofth","Phorm can't seem to get the hang of staying out of the news (possibly because
it's now hired a small army of PR people). So here's your roundup on what's been
going on.

Latest is its preliminary results for the full year to December 31, and notes
from the first quarter of 2008, in which the notable points include a $30m
(£15m) equity fundraising; OIX (its advertising portal) and Webwise
""successfully launched in February 2008"", ""significant progress made with the
advertising and publishing community"", ""advanced talks with other ISPs both in
the UK and internationally"", ""positive initial feedback from a number of
regulatory bodies"" and - on March 19 - another $65m equity fundraising.

OK, but as Sir Alan Sugar would ask, what about the numbers?

Operating losses for 2007 were $32.8m (post-tax $32.6m), making a loss per share
of $2.74. The balance sheet showed net assets on December 31 of $15.1m (of cash
and equivalents: $16.6m) and ""virtually no debt"". Net cash used was $22.4m, and
mostly funded by the equity fundraising, after issue costs, of $35.2m. 

Which means that at that sort of burn rate, even if (big if) there's no cash
inflow, Phorm could carry on for nearly four years without needing more money.

There's also plenty about high-powered appointments to the board - from
Coca-Cola, BT, aQuantive (an ad-serving company lately acquired by Microsoft)
and AT&T. If the pedigree of your board members was cash in the bank, Phorm
would be rich. But that's not how companies are, or should be, judged.

An interesting quote from Ertegrul:

Our technology complies with all relevant data protection and privacy laws
including RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act) and the Data Protection
Act 

And:

Furthermore, we have initiated a dialogue with the Information Commissioner's
Office who are pleased with the way that we have engaged with technical experts
and concerned individuals following the announcement of the service. 

But what's the ICO got to say? Looking at its statement
[http://www.ico.gov.uk/Home/about_us/news_and_views/current_topics/phorm_webwise_and_oie.aspx]
, we note that it says

Regulation 7 of PECR [Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003] 
will require the ISP to get the consent of users to the use of their traffic
data for any value added services. This strongly supports the view that Phorm
products will have to operate on an opt in basis to use traffic data as part of
the process of returning relevant targeted marketing to internet users. Whether
or not the Phorm products are a concern for the Commissioner will depend on the
extent to which the assurances Phorm has provided so far are true. [emphasis
added - CA] 

If Phorm has to go opt-in, I suspect that would leave it grounded before it
starts. If anyone has figures on how many people opt in to services (as opposed
to opting out), I'd love to hear.

And finally in this roundup, Phorm's marketing team has been caught
wiki-fiddling. Specifically, altering the Wikipedia page about it to make it,
um, more friendly. But as you'd expect, this was noticed and almost instantly
reverted. The side-by-side before and after comparison
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phorm&diff=next&oldid=203246326] is
interesting, but it's more fun to look at the Phorm-edited version
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phorm&oldid=203246326] and the one
before it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phorm&oldid=203103080]; a
notable change being that the quote by the Guardian's advertising people is
shortened significantly (""Our decision was in no small part down to the
conversations we had internally about how this product sits with the values of
our company"" vanishes).

Phorm admitted
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/phorm_censors_wikipedia/] doing this,
telling the Register it ""wanted to clarify a number of inaccuracies"". Hmm, but
it hardly fits with the NPOV
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view], does it?

""called on Google's founders and directors to adopt new privacy safeguards that
allow for anonymous internet and software use"". In a video
[http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/corporateering/articles/?storyId=23623], the
organisation criticises Google Suggest, and the Incognito mode in Google's
Chrome browser. It says:

Chrome's Incognito mode lulls consumers into a false sense of security that
their actions are completely private and free from prying eyes when in fact they
are not. 
""Chrome provides Google unprecedented dominance over the transmission of
computer data and warrants higher privacy standards,"" wrote Consumer Watchdog
President Jamie Court and Policy Advocate John Simpson.

The site provides a form letter
[http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/corporateering/corpact4/] you can send ""to ask
Google's board of directors to agree to basic privacy rights for all Web users"".
You can, of course, turn Google Suggest off. However, its combination of search
logs, Google applications such as Gmail, advertising tracking across the web,
the Google Toolbar and Chrome browser enable Google to harvest vast amounts of
information about the things users do.

Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 has an InPrivate mode, and Apple's Safari
has a Private Browsing mode. Yesterday, Private Browsing was also added to the
pre-release (developer) versions of Firefox 3.1, according to a blog post by
Ehsan Akhgari: Don't leave a trace: Private Browsing in Firefox
[http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2008-11-04/dont-leave-trace-private-browsing-firefox]
. He also explains how to start Firefox in Private Browsing mode. However, as he
says:

Private Browsing aims to help you make sure that your web browsing activities
don't leave any trace on your own computer. It is very important to note that
Private Browsing is not a tool to keep you anonymous from websites or your ISP,
or for example protect you from all kinds of spyware applications which use
sophisticated techniques to intercept your online traffic. Private Browsing is
only about making sure that Firefox doesn't store any data which can be used to
trace your online activities, no more, no less.

It will be interesting to see if it makes any difference. Not many people
actually go in for anonymous browsing

out that contrary to a remark made in the original version of the above podcast,

"technology/blog/2008/oct/16/internet-bt","I wanted to share something with you today that I think you can probably help me
out with. It's about Phorm, the controversial behavioural ad company
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/06/internet.privacy] that's
partnered with British ISPs, including BT. We've written about them quite a bit
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2008/sep/16/2] in recent months
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/30/phorm.new].

Anyway, last week I got an email from one of BT's PR guys. As you can expect,
we've had some fairly robust discussions with them recently. This time he was
pointing out some comments from the Guardian's director of digital strategy
[http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/532476.php], Simon Waldman, who said
recently that industry needed ""intelligent discussion"" about the issue of
behavioural ads and that ""scaremongering"" was no good. 

BT's point, I suppose, was to suggest that we were stirring up exactly that sort
of trouble and being hypocritical to boot.

Fortunately, I have no problem with making trouble if it's required. I don't
feel an overwhelming need to be neutral about things that are opposed to our
civil rights. But I can try to be fair. 

So, in that spirit of fairness, I responded by sending back an email laying out
an argument showing why I think Phorm is problematic, and why BT should spend
more time worrying about why it's doing this than it does badgering its critics.
I didn't get a response back from them, but I've included the text below
because, to my mind, it articulates the problem pretty clearly. 

However: I want it to be better, because I think this is very important issue.
And that's where you can help. I've tried to explain why people have a problem
with Phorm and what the controversy is really about. But have I got it right? Do
you disagree? Is there a way we can make this argument clearer, or more
accurate? 

Read on for the relevant part of the email, and then leave suggestions, disputes
or advice in the comments.

Here's my problem with Phorm, in a nutshell, which might explain why I don't
think we're going to stop writing about it any time soon:

If you monitored the phone calls I made - not necessarily what was said in them,
but who they were made to and when - and then sold my number on to cold callers
for a commission, I'd get pretty pissed off. And most people, I'm sure, would
feel pretty similar.

Not just because cold calls are annoying - they are - but because it's an abuse
of your privileged position as service provider.

BT is not running a website that users choose to visit. It's not running a
service that users can switch away from easily. 

You're the gatekeeper. It's your job to protect your customers, not use what you
know about them for commercial advantage. And it helps to be straight with them
too, rather than this feeling that you're trying to get everything past them
when they're not looking. 

It might not be against the law, but that doesn't mean it's not against the
spirit of doing right by your customers.

Your help appreciated.","Technology","2008-10-16T06:26:26Z","Your help please: Why does Phorm concern you?","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/oct/16/internet-bt"
"technology/2005/sep/08/onlinesupplement.insideit","The Obscene Publications Act makes it illegal to publish material that tends to
deprave and corrupt those viewing it. When passed in 1959, and even when
equivalent Scottish legislation was passed in 1982, it was difficult for
publishers to distribute such material from abroad.

With the internet, such publication is very easy. In 1988, laws passed in both
England and Scotland also criminalised possession - which includes viewing
images online - of indecent images of children.

But this is not the case for extreme adult pornography: images of serious sexual
violence, necrophilia and bestiality. Last week, the Home Office and Scottish
Executive proposed changing this, making possession punishable by up to three
years in prison.

In a foreword to the public consultation, which is open until December 2, Home
Office minister Paul Goggins and Scottish Executive justice minister Cathy
Jamieson say that these offences ""will mirror the arrangements already in place
in respect of child pornography. The intention is to reduce the demand for such
material and to send a clear message that it has no place in our society"".

But would such legislation achieve much beyond sending a message? The
consultation notes: ""We are not aware of any western jurisdiction which
prohibits simple possession of extreme material.""

By contrast, possession of indecent images of children is illegal in numerous
countries, enabling international co-operation. The UK's largest investigation
of online paedophile activity, Operation Ore, relied on the US Federal Bureau of
Investigations collecting around 250,000 credit cards numbers used to pay for
access to a US child pornography web-site, and passing on more than 7,000 from
the UK.

Formal structures are being created for such cooperation, such as the Virtual
Global Taskforce, which includes the UK's National Crime Squad, police agencies
in Australia, Canada and the US and Interpol. In December 2003 the taskforce
launched Operation PIN, setting up fake child abuse web-sites. These captured
the details of a number of individuals when they attempted to download an image,
then told them that they had committed an offence and their data would be passed
to the relevant national authority. It is usually possible to trace web users
through data recorded by a web server.

A National Crime Squad spokesperson says that no prosecutions followed this data
collection, but adds that the priority was crime reduction. The taskforce is
also planning a 24-hour-a-day online policing presence, with officers from the
four member countries involved in online patrols such as overt visits to
chatrooms. This will be discussed at a meeting between the member agencies in
Canberra next week.

In June, the G8 club of rich countries agreed to help Interpol to establish a £2
million system linking countries' databases of such images, and later this month
the UK will hand an implementation study on this to Interpol. The UK's national
database, Childbase, contains 800,000 images, allowing swifter identification of
victims using facial recognition.

Such international cooperation would help in investigating extreme pornography,
as all the publishers appear to be outside the UK. The Internet Watch Foundation
says that 60% of the 140 adult pornographic sites it checked in the first six
months of this year which appeared to contravene the Obscene Publications Act
appeared to be US-based, with 14% in China and 4% in Russia. None was British.

In an emailed response, an FBI spokesperson says cooperation similar to
Operation Ore would be possible for extreme pornography, adding: ""It is not an
easy answer though. In the US we have obscenity laws that make it a violation to
post lewd material online. How that is defined and enforced is reviewed on a
case-by-case basis,"" by enforcement agencies and government prosecutors.

""Policing this, from a single country point of view, is going to be a
nightmare,"" predicts Tony Dearsley, senior computer investigations manager at UK
computer forensics firm Vogon International. ""How do you get to these people?
Like most cross-border issues, unless you have got an agreement or an identical
offence, it will be very unlikely to get a warrant to get information or shut [a
site] down."" He adds that extreme pornography is often free to access, without
requiring the credit card payments which enabled Operation Ore.

Dearsley says that Vogon has seen such material on computers belonging to
suspects in rape and murder cases: hard drives often retain traces of all files
they have stored, despite attempts to erase and overwrite them.

This could represent an alternative way to investigate the proposed crime. A
Home Office spokesperson says that data on a suspect's computer often gives
clues to others, adding that employers, internet service providers, credit card
providers and the public would also be likely to provide leads.

But David Wilson, professor of criminology at the University of Central England,
says that technological change is likely to make policing possession of extreme
pornography very difficult. His research with paedophiles found that, after
Operation Ore, they switched to peer-to-peer networks and net-enabled mobile
telephones. ""Usually, the law's a step behind,"" says Professor Wilson. ""You have
to look at why society produces these people in the first place.""

"technology/2011/apr/11/cps-bt-phorm-appeal","Privacy groups have attacked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) after it
decided not to prosecute BT and Phorm for secretly tracking the online habits of
18,000 internet users.

BT and Phorm sparked a privacy backlash in 2006 and 2007 when it emerged
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/03/privacy.telecoms] that the
companies were covertly trialling software that tracked peoples' internet
behaviour in order to deliver targeted advertising. BT, the UK's largest
broadband provider, ditched
[http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/btgroup-privacy-and-the-net] 
the controversial system in 2009.

The CPS ruled on Friday [http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_releases/116_11/] that
there was insufficient evidence to prosecute BT and Phorm under the Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which makes it an offence to intercept
internet traffic without either the user's explicit consent or a judicial
warrant.

Simon Davies, director of the campaign group Privacy International, said his
organisation would appeal for a judicial review of the CPS ruling but feared
that it would ""fall flat on its face"" into a ""legal black hole"".

""Going to appeal against BT or Phorm – or even Google – in the UK is simply
going to fall flat on its face,"" Davies told the Guardian. ""There's a real risk
that big corporations are escaping scot-free whenever they violate the rights of
people in the UK. There doesn't appear to be any legal infrastructure to tackle
these companies.""

Davies said he felt that budget cuts were forcing law enforcement agencies to be
more selective with investigations. ""It's fundamentally a problem with the
budget freeze,"" he said. ""The police can't find any legal powers or aren't
prepared to because of the cost – so our complaints fall into a legal blackhole.
That's got to be dealt with.""

The CPS on Friday said that a prosecution against BT and Phorm ""would not be in
the public interest"". It said that any offending was ""the result of an honest
mistake or genuine misunderstanding of the law"" and that there was no evidence
that anyone ""suffered any loss or harm"" as a result of the trial.

Jim Killock, the executive director of the internet advocacy organisation Open
Rights Group, accused the government of ""perpetuating a muddle"" over which body
investigates potential internet privacy breaches. ""The CPS isn't equipped to
make legal judgments in this area, which involves complex industrial
regulation,"" he said. ""It requires proper regulation with a proper regulator.""

Daniel Hamilton, the campaign director at privacy pressure group Big Brother
Watch, said he was ""not at all surprised"" by the ruling. He added: ""Whether it's
a CPS investigation or an information commissioner investigation, [these bodies
have] consistently shown themselves to be unwilling to take action.""

BT said it was pleased that the CPS had decided not to prosecute. Phorm had not
returned a request for comment at time of publication.

BT stopped using Phorm tracking technology in 2009, after a second, public,
series of trials. The setback accelerated a downward spiral for the AIM-listed
technology firm, which once promised to boost the value of advertising for most
of the UK's leading internet service providers, including Virgin Media and
TalkTalk.

Phorm left the UK market towards the end of 2009, as popular websites like
Amazon and the once-dominant MySpace publicly expressed their concern over its
behavioural advertising technology. The US-based firm last year announced an
attempt to woo Brazil and China
[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985ff078-38d5-11df-9998-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1JCQ4snUu]
.

Phorm recorded a pre-tax loss of $29.35m (£17.95m) in 2009, the last full year
for which information is available, with no recorded turnover. Even during the
US-based firm's heyday, in 2006, Phorm reported a pre-tax loss of $11.54m, on
revenues of $1.27m.","Technology","2011-04-11T16:30:02Z","CPS under attack over BT and Phorm's covert online monitoring","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/11/cps-bt-phorm-appeal"

agenda. He explains the directives that will enable us to switch mobile

"commentisfree/2009/apr/15/phorm-internet-privacy-european-union","Nothing is going well for the Phorm [http://www.theguardian.com/business/phorm] 
behavioural advertising system this week. The EU commission has started legal
action
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/15/internet-privacy-eu-legal-action] 
because the UK hasn't regulated it properly, and now Amazon are joining
LiveJournal, mySociety and others in demanding an immediate end to the
monitoring of traffic to their websites.

The Phorm system learns your interests by snooping on your internet web traffic.
Your ISP does the necessary wiretap in exchange for a cut when advertisers pay a
premium for learning precisely what to try and sell you. It's rather like the
postman getting money to peek at your letters, so you can receive a better class
of junk mail.

It's hardly necessary to use the language of privacy, because the law says it's
illegal to intercept internet traffic without permission from both ends of the
link. However, legal niceties don't seem to have worried BT, the UK's largest
ISP
[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/02/privacy-civil-liberties].
They've spent years trying to get the technical kinks out of the system. Last
autumn's trial
[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39578006,00.htm] was
half-way legal (or as lawyers say, completely illegal) because they finally
asked one end of the link (their customers) for permission; a nicety they
ignored in earlier secret tests.

Naturally people have been complaining
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/mar/17/fiprquerieslegalityofphorm]
; to the information commissioner, to the interception tribunal and to the
police. The first two don't think it's their bailiwick, and the City of London
police refused to act; apparently because BT didn't really intend to do anything
wrong – a novel legal theory, which I assume they will be dusting off again
after recent tragic events.

Frustrated, the complainers have headed for Brussels, where for the first time
they got a serious hearing. The commission saw that EU law was broken and
swapped letters with Whitehall. They responded that no UK statute was infringed,
either in the recent trial where half the necessary permission was sought, or in
the earlier totally secret regimes.

Brussels has believed what they were told – which is not as disappointing as it
sounds, for yesterday they took the first steps towards dragging the UK before
the European court for a failure to correctly implement EU law and prevent
illegal interception. They're also, to their particular credit, concerned about
the process issues, and want to know why there is no institution in the UK
tasked with dealing with companies performing illegal interception.

So Whitehall now has to decide whether to enact a new law, or to reread the one
we already have and write back contritely to Brussels. Sadly, history suggests
they'll just brazen it out until a European court rules against the UK once
again. Our current wiretap laws result directly from adverse judgments in Malone
(1984) and Halford (1997). So, as they say in legal circles, Whitehall's got
form.","Opinion","2009-04-15T12:37:34Z","Richard Clayton: Will criticism from the EU change the UK's law on internet privacy?","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/15/phorm-internet-privacy-european-union"
"technology/2009/apr/16/amazon-phorm-targeted-advertising","Amazon has opted out of Phorm's controversial targeted advertising technology,
delivering a serious blow to the UK-listed company which has already prompted a
European commission legal action against the British government. Phorm's
technology, which is yet to be launched in the UK, allows ISPs to track their
customers' activity on the internet in order to target adverts on pages they
subsequently visit.

Amazon's absence from Phorm's Webwise system deprives the company of the second
most visited destination, after eBay.co.uk [http://www.eBay.co.uk], among
shopping and classified websites in the UK, according to data from Hitwise. It
means Phorm will not have access to crucial information about what Amazon users
are interested in.

Last month the Open Rights Group, privacy campaigners, sent a letter to nine of
the internet's biggest names, including Amazon, Google, Bebo, Facebook and
Yahoo, asking them to opt out of Phorm's technology ""to protect your users'
privacy"". 

Google and Bebo are actively considering whether to opt out and a spokesman for
Amazon said the company has now removed all its domain names - including 
Amazon.com [http://www.Amazon.com] - from Webwise. A spokesman for Phorm said
the company does not comment on individual cases but the it is understood to be
planning a meeting with Amazon's management to explain the benefits of the
Webwise system.

But it is the latest blow to a company whose online tracking technology has
infuriated privacy campaigners and is now worrying EU lawmakers. On Tuesday, the
EC launched legal proceedings against the government for breaching data
protection and ePrivacy rules as a result of secret testing of Phorm's
technology by BT in 2006 and 2007. The commission wants the rules covering
interception of online traffic to be tightened. Viviane Reding, the EU telecoms
commissioner, made it plain that she is becoming increasingly concerned about
advertising that is based on the collection of details of a user's online
behaviour. 

""Do you want to turn the internet into a jungle? This could happen if we cannot
control the use of our information online,"" she said. ""There is an undeniable
risk that privacy is being lost to the brave new world of intrusive
technologies.""

The sheer amount of negative press surrounding Phorm's technology has left its
creators with a challenge. It needs users to sign up for the service in order
for it to work, but a survey of 1,000 British internet users by research
specialist TNS showed that there is resistance to targeted advertising among
surfers. Although 47% of people liked the idea of having ads tailored to their
tastes, 41% still saw targeted advertising as an abuse of their privacy. 

To persuade people to sign up Phorm is looking at the possibility of incentives
for users. They could be offered cheaper deals, faster speeds or charitable
donations made by their internet service provider (ISP) to encourage them to
sign up.","Technology","2009-04-15T23:01:00Z","Amazon opts out of Phorm's targeted internet advertising system after privacy fears","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/16/amazon-phorm-targeted-advertising"
"technology/2009/apr/02/dotcom-boycott-advertising-phorm","Digital technology company Phorm is facing a major setback, with several of the
world's largest dotcom companies considering boycotting its controversial online
advertising technology.

Last month Open Rights Group, the privacy campaign group, sent a letter to nine
of the internet's biggest names – including Google, Bebo, Facebook and Yahoo –
asking them to opt out of Phorm's technology ""to protect your users' privacy"".

UK-listed Phorm has developed technology that allows internet service providers
to track what their users are doing online. ISPs can then sell that information
to media companies and advertisers who can use it to place more relevant adverts
on websites the user subsequently visits.

The technology has been tested by BT in the UK, with Virgin Media and Carphone
Warehouse's TalkTalk also interested in using it.

Although Phorm emphasises that the information is made anonymous and consumers
can opt out, it has been attacked by privacy campaigners as online snooping.

Phorm's technology could falter without the involvement of the major dotcom
brands as potential advertisers. Google is understood to be considering
boycotting Phorm; a spokesman said a response to the Open Rights Group's letter
is expected in days.

A spokesperson for Bebo, meanwhile, said: ""We have received the letter and are
giving it careful consideration from privacy and business perspectives.""

Rival social networking site Facebook believes it is up to individual web users
to lobby their ISPs if they have concerns about the use of Phorm's technology. 
Last month Facebook's privacy chief Chris Kelly said
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/24/facebook_dpi/ ]: ""If [users] are deeply
unhappy with it we hope they express that as clearly as possible to the ISPs.""

Online advertising insiders point out that it is no surprise that companies such
as Google are looking to boycott Phorm – its technology is in direct competition
with their own attempts to get involved in ""behavioural targeted advertising"".

In 2007 Google, which already dominated the online search market, snapped up
internet advertising network Double­Click, which serves adverts to many of the
internet's top websites. Google already had a massive amount of information
about what visitors to its own search engine were interested in, which it could
use to place relevant results on its Google.com site, but the DoubleClick deal
extended its reach to third party websites.

Three weeks ago Google started testing ""behaviourally targeted"" advertising on
some of those sites, including the New York Times, Reuters, Napster, ITN,
AutoTrader and Rolling Stone.

Its service uses a temporary ID tagged on to a user's browser, known as a
cookie, to track what that user does online. When the user visits a website in
Google's advertising network, that website owner can show them an advert based
on what they have been doing elsewhere on the web.

Cookies are already in widespread use on the internet, but the sheer scale of
Google has raised concerns about it testing even more intrusive online snooping.
Google, however, allows user to opt out of its new advertising system by
accessing the privacy settings on its homepage.","Media","2009-04-02T18:08:04Z","Dotcom companies consider boycott of Phorm's online advertising technology","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/02/dotcom-boycott-advertising-phorm"

two areas in which the EU has stepped into the gaping hole left by the UK
government.

In December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that retaining the DNA of
the innocent
[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2008/dec/04/blogpost] 
breached article eight of the human rights convention. Britain urgently needs a
debate on DNA retention as public discourse on the topic has been sidetracked by
a ""for it or against it"" tone. The debate should focus on why it is retained,
how and with what safeguards. These protections are key. Firstly, the regulation
of private sector data collection and storage needs to be tightened; and
secondly, the increasingly porous boundaries between public and private data
need to be clarified.

Europe stepped into the breach when the European Commissionlaunched infringement
proceedings
[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/15/phorm-internet-privacy-european-union] 
against the UK for failing to regulate the internet advertising company Phorm
[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/02/privacy-civil-liberties].
Although public controversy surrounding the technology company has centred on
BT's secret trials of its system in 2006; the real issue is that Phorm's
innovations, which would allow internet service providers to track customers,
exist in a legal grey area. Shockingly, freedom of information requests have
just revealed that the Home Office was consulting Phorm on whether the
government's interpretation of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/14/regulation-investigatory-powers-act] 
was an analysis that suited Phorm. It also asked if Phorm wanted to amend the
interpretation. Yesterday the counter-terrorism minister Lord West
[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/lord_west_of_spithead] would not comment on
these revelations. Perhaps this is because the Home Office would like to utilise
similar technologies themselves.

The second real danger for privacy is the sharing of information between
databases and between the public and private sector. The dangerously permissive
proposals for data sharing in the coroners and justice bill
[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/19/coroners-justice-bill]
, which have now been withdrawn, would have allowed information sharing between
data controllers in public bodies and the private sector. These blurred
boundaries between the public and private sectors made news this week with the
revelation that the Department of Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform gave
the energy company E.ON secret police information
[http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/20/police-intelligence-e-on-berr] 
regarding the peaceful protest at Kingsnorth power station. It is one thing for
the police to gather intelligence about a demonstration. It is quite another for
the government to be able to access that information and then leak it to a
private company.

This leak is yet another example of why the public shouldn't trust the
government with its private data. Currently the rules for data storage and
access to data are being dealt with separately. The government thinks that this
approach is logical. However while it may be rational, it is not reasonable. It
is like asking someone to put their valuables in a safe without telling them
who's got the key. The problem at the moment is that the government is intent on
cutting a copy of that key for just about everybody. Until it understands that
personal data is valuable, we shouldn't trust the key holder.","Opinion","2009-04-24T10:00:00Z","Sue Miller: The great British data free-for-all","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/apr/24/data-protection-europe"

dominating internet traffic across the globe. 

Stefano De Sabbata [http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/?id=321] and Dr Mark Graham
[http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/graham/] from the Oxford Internet Institute
[http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/] have tried to show this with a map visualising each
country's most popular website using a design that pays homage to the Age of
Empires [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires] video game series.

You can click on the map below to zoom in and see the countries in detail. There
is a key showing the websites featured at the bottom left of the map. 

The researchers explain their methodology on their Information Geographies
[http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/2013/09/age-of-internet-empires/] blog:

The map uses freely available data retrieved from Alexa [http://www.alexa.com/] 
on August 12th, 2013. The company has provided website analytics since 1996.
Alexa collects data from millions of internet users using one of over 25,000
different browser extensions, and the data used for this visualization
[http://www.alexa.com/help/traffic-learn-more] were calculated ""using a
combination of the estimated average daily unique visitors to a site and the
estimated number of pageviews on that site from users in that country over the
past month"".

The data are visualised as a choropleth map, where the colour indicates each
country's most visited website. Starting from the evident dominance of two
companies (Google and Facebook), whose colours (red and blue, respectively)
cover most of the map, we styled the illustration as an old colonial map
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:British_colonies_1763-76_shepherd1923.PNG],
and named it after the computer game series Age of Empires
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires].

THE AGE OF INTERNET EMPIRES
So Google and Facebook rule most of the world except Asia where local providers
have managed to maintain their domination of the market. 

The researchers point out that Google is the most visited website in the
majority of European, North American and Oceanian countries while Facebook
dominates in the Middle East, North Africa and most Spanish-speaking countries
in South America.

The once dominant Yahoo! maintains a stronghold in Japan, where it is branded
Yahoo Japan! (as a joint venture with Japanese company SoftBank) and also in
Taiwan.

Unfortunately there are some countries missing from the map, as the researchers
explain:

Alexa does not provide much information about countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
However, most countries that have a significant Internet population are covered.
Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, and South Africa fall within the sphere of Google's
empire, whereas Ghana, Senegal, and Sudan have been subsumed within Facebook's
dominion.

SIZE IS NOT EVERYTHING
The countries where Google is dominant contain half of the internet's whole
population, with over one billion users. 

Although the locations it dominates contain more landmass, Facebook loses out to
Chinese search engine Baidu when it comes to total internet population.

To illustrate this discrepancy De Sabbata and Graham have also displayed the
data on a map where countries are sized by internet population.

"technology/2013/nov/19/google-pay-17-million-apple-tracking","Google is paying $17m to 37 US states and the District of Columbia as
compensation for snooping on millions of people by subverting Apple's web
browser in 2011 and 2012.

The settlement, announced on Monday evening, follows a record $22.5m fine handed
out to the search giant in August 2012
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/09/google-record-fine-ftc-safari] 
over the same complaint by the US Federal Trade Commission.

The settlement came after Google admitted in 2012 that it had circumvented
protections built into Apple's Safari browser on the iPhone, iPad and Mac to
track users via its DoubleClick advertising network. 

Apple's default settings ban sites which users have not visited from setting
""cookies"", small text files with information about the user and site, on their
machine. Cookies can act as unique identifiers of a user; if two unrelated sites
used DoubleClick for advertising - as many do - and a Safari user went from one
to the other, their movements could be tracked by Google.

Google admitted that it had carried out the hacking of the Safari browser in
February 2012, but did not admit liability, the same position that it adopted
with the FTC. This was important in that judgement because an admission of
liability could have left Google subject to a much larger fine on the grounds
that it breached a previous FTC consent order over user privacy. That was 
imposed in March 2011 over its ""Buzz"" social network
[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/03/google.shtm] and will be in force for 20 years.

Google has maintained the Safari intrusion was an inadvertent side-effect of an
attempt to make it easier for people to recommend ads.

Until the problem was uncovered by Jonathan Mayer, a graduate student at
Stanford University, Google had assured Safari users that they wouldn't be
monitored as long as they didn't change the browser settings to permit the
tracking.

""Misrepresenting that tracking will not occur, when that is not the case, is
unacceptable, as this settlement emphasises,"" Wisconsin Attorney General J.B.
Van Hollen said.

""We work hard to get privacy right at Google and have taken steps to remove the
ad cookies, which collected no personal information, from Apple's browsers,"" the
company said in a statement. ""We're pleased to have worked with the state
attorneys general to reach this agreement.""

The settlement will be divided among the participating states and the District
of Columbia.

The states' rebuke is primarily a PR blow to Google, whose privacy controls have
suffered other lapses in recent years. The most glaring privacy breach came when
a Google engineer installed a program which enabled Google cars collecting
pictures of street scenes to also scoop up personal data being transmitted over
unprotected Wi-Fi networks. That led to a $7m fine from 38 US states and the
District of Columbia, while the Federal Communications Commission fined it
$25,000 for obstructing its investigation into what happened.

The latest settlement will barely dent Google's finances. After stripping out
the company's advertising commissions, Google's revenue this year is expected to
be about $47bn, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That suggests it
would take Google slightly more than three hours to generate $17m in revenue on
an average day.

Besides paying the fine, Google also is agreeing to maintain a special page
devoted to cookies for the next five years and refrain making any misleading
statements about its online tracking practices.","Technology","2013-11-19T18:12:00Z","Google pays US states $17m to settle Apple web browser tracking complaint","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/19/google-pay-17-million-apple-tracking"

"technology/blog/2013/may/24/internet-privacy-cookies-firefox","When the Cookie Directive, officially known as the EU e-Privacy Directive, was
first drafted two years ago, tablets hadn't been adopted in their millions, and
smartphones had nothing like their present-day ubiquity.

Their rise in popularity raises a number of difficult issues for publishers and
other website owners when it comes to the directive, which has now been in place
for 12 months, not least because of the way mobile devices deal with cookies,
those small bits of code left by web browsers on your computer or mobile devices
that personalise your online experience.

To complicate matters, not all cookies are the same. There are session-based
cookies, or temporary cookie files which are erased when you close your browser,
and persistent cookies, that stay in one of your browser's subfolders until you
delete them manually or until your browser deletes them based on the duration
period contained within the persistent cookie's file.

These persistent cookies can stay in your browser for anything from 18 months to
18 years. Of all the cookies written onto users' browsers, roughly half are
first party and belong to the site you are visiting, and half are third party,
and belong to partners, services or advertisers working with the site.

Nearly a third of all page views in the UK now occur on a smartphone or tablet,
according to ComScore, with one in five UK users using their smartphone to buy
online during the three months ending January 2013. But users are more aware
than ever of the potential threat to their privacy.

According to a survey by online privacy management services provider TRUSTe at
the start of this year, 66% of smartphone users are now more concerned about
their privacy on the devices than a year ago, while 79% say they avoid using
apps they don't believe protect their privacy online.

The mobile landscape is still developing and the way that mobiles and tablets
deal with cookies is inconsistent. It's a complicated and changing environment
which merits some attention from the information commissioner.

With first-party cookies, there are not really significant issues, as they
improve the user online experience, enabling you to stay logged on, remember
passwords, items in your shopping basket and so on. The difficulty arises with
third-party cookies, which are used to track activity and recognise frequent and
returning visitors, to optimise advertising, or improve the user experience by
tailoring content or offers, based on that cookie's history.

Apple's Safari, for instance, blocks third-party cookies such as those from
advertisers, so it's impossible to track a highly significant portion of the
mobile audience, the iPhone users, when they're online. Mozilla is joining Apple
in the latest version of its Firefox browser and intends to disable third-party
cookies.

Why is any of this important? In short, the current web environment requires
user movements to be tracked, and cookies are needed to achieve this. And it's
right that the placing of cookies on computers and mobile devices should be
monitored and users protected from unscrupulous elements. But the internet
simply would not work without cookies – they are a fundamental currency of the
internet, enabling web analytics as well as tailoring the online experience,
compiling a browsing history and the rest.

In particular, third-party cookies are critical for the automated trading that
has come to dominate digital media since the Cookie Directive was introduced.
It's no exaggeration to say that there has been a sea change in the volume and
usage of third-party cookies over the last year because of the rise of automated
trading methods like real-time bidding. The marketplace for exchange-traded
media has doubled in the past quarter and has grown 184% over the past year,
according to a recent report from Accordant Media.

The internet runs on an advertising model, and payback for it being free to
users is that their movements and behaviour online can be tracked by
advertisers. In fact, 23% of UK users are ""OK with companies tracking me in
exchange for free services or content"" according to TRUSTe's research, accepting
that such an exchange keeps the services free or low priced.

The move from Firefox is of concern for AOP members because it raises the
possibility that other browser makers could follow suit, which may mean that
even publishers' first-party cookies would be seen as third-party cookies by a
browser and disabled, denying the user the benefits and convenience they
provide.

A year ago, the UK's information commissioner ruled that websites only have to
obtain implied rather than explicit consent from users before cookies or any
other form of data can be stored on their browser, and most website owners have
interpreted this to mean that it is sufficient just to alert users that their
sites use cookies.

Twelve months on, this stance has yet to be proven, and in the meanwhile, the
mrket has developed to become much more complex. The UK has the slackest
regulation of all EU members; other member states are much more stringent in
their approach. In the UK, no one knows how far they can go and there is a real
risk that the desktop internet could become over-legislated while mobile
internet becomes under-legislated.

It's an issue for all websites, whether they are well-resourced businesses like
the premium publishers represented by the AOP, or smaller businesses which may
fall foul of the regulations more easily. For the benefit of both users and web
site providers we need more guidance on best practice and more clarity from the
information commissioner.

Incisive Media","Technology","2013-05-24T13:48:20Z","Internet users' privacy concerns may mean cookies start to crumble","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/24/internet-privacy-cookies-firefox"
"technology/2011/dec/18/new-cookie-laws-john-naughton","Feeling bored and listless? Well, try this. In Firefox, open ""preferences"",
click on the ""privacy tab"" and then click on the link that says ""remove
individual cookies"". Up will pop a dialogue box labelled ""cookies"", which tells
you that ""the following cookies are stored in your computer"". If you're an
intensive user of the web, it will be a very long, scrolling list. On my laptop,
for example, Amazon has deposited 29 cookies, YouTube nine and Google a whopping
53. (For instructions for how to inspect cookies in other browsers, see the 
NetLingo [http://www.netlingo.com/more/cookies.php] site.)

Cookies are small text files, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded on to
a computer when its user accesses a website. The first thing to say about them
is that they do not make for bedside reading. For example, one of my Amazon
cookies begins with the phrase ""%20s_dl%3D1%7C131818459"" and goes on like that
for four and a half lines. To Amazon's web server, however, this gibberish is
riveting stuff because it provides useful information about how I use the site.
Maybe it reveal details of my browsing history. Or provides information about
what I bought recently. The point is that I can't tell how the cookie crumbles:
that's something that only Amazon knows.

The idea that websites secretly deposit files on your computer – without your
consent – will strike some people as creepy, and indeed in some ways it is. But
it does have some positive benefits. For example, it makes the web more useable
by enabling sites to bypass a lot of procedural stuff that would slow things up.
Thus a cookie is what enables a site to recognise returning visitors so that
they don't have to log in every time they show up. And in some cases cookies are
essential – for example in online retail sites, as shoppers accumulate items in
a shopping basket on their way to a virtual checkout.

So cookies are an important, and in some cases vital, component of web
technology. But like any technology, they can be – and increasingly are – abused
[http://www.cookiecentral.com/ccstory/cc3.htm]. For example, advertisers and
websites use cookies to build detailed profiles of users and their browsing
habits. Some time ago I went to the website of a leading British retail chain
looking for information about digital cameras, and for ages afterwards ads from
that chain kept popping up on other – unrelated – sites that I visited. This was
almost certainly accomplished using cookies.

This kind of ""tracking"" behaviour eventually attracted the baleful attention of
the EU, which since 2003 has required anyone using cookies to provide clear
information about them. In May this year these rules were dramatically
tightened: now, anyone depositing cookies is required not just to provide clear
information about them but also to obtain consent from users to store a cookie
on their device. The only exceptions are cases where cookies are essential for
the provision of a service (as in an online shopping basket). So since May,
anyone setting a cookie without obtaining the explicit consent of the user is
technically breaking the law.

Needless to say, this intrusion of EU red tape into Britons' ancient right to do
as they damn well please generated much heated commentary. The jackbooted thugs
of Brussels were, we were told, going to ""kill the internet"". But the law is the
law and, alarmed by the lack of preparedness of British industry, the government
negotiated a year-long ""lead-in period"" to give businesses time to adapt to the
new reality.

We're now midway through that period, and the information commissioner – the guy
who will have to enforce the new rules – has just issued a half-term report
[http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/blog/2011/half-term-report-on-cookies-compliance.aspx] 
on how things are going. His verdict, he writes, ""can be summed up by the
schoolteacher's favourite clichés: 'could do better' and 'must try harder'. A
report that listed the URLs of sites that were perfectly compliant from day one
would be very short indeed. This is not a surprise to anyone who recognises that
redeveloping and redesigning is no easy task.""

That's putting it mildly. A random survey of some prominent websites by this
columnist suggests that their owners haven't yet appreciated what the new rules
require. Mostly they bury information about cookies in a link labelled ""privacy
policy"" in small type at the bottom of their home pages. The link explains that
the company deposits cookies before going on to say that if the user declines
said cookies, the company ""cannot guarantee that your experience with the site
will be as quick or responsive as if you do receive cookies"". If this is what
British companies regard as seeking the informed consent of users, then they
have a nasty shock coming. And the information commissioner is going to be busy
from next June onwards.","Technology","2011-12-18T00:25:00Z","EU cookie laws could cause unwary firms to get their fingers burnt","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/18/new-cookie-laws-john-naughton"
"commentisfree/2016/jun/14/im-being-chased-around-the-internet-by-a-shed","A few weeks ago, I thought about buying a shed. I thought about buying a shed,
and it was the most exciting thing I did that day, because I’m a hot-rod rebel
and my entire life is a thrill-a-minute joyride of unimaginable debauchery.

In the end, however, I didn’t buy a shed – mainly because it turns out that my
tolerance for sheds is so abysmally low that I can only look at a maximum of
three sheds before deciding that all sheds are stupid and only ninnies need
them. However, that hasn’t stopped me from being ambushed by adverts for sheds
on a near-hourly basis ever since.

Thanks to a web cookie on the shed site telling an ad server that this is now my
defining personality trait – Stuart Heritage: shed enjoyer – the vast majority
of adverts I see online are now for sheds. It feels as if I’m being stalked by
sheds. It feels as if I’m living in the first draft of an Edgar Allan Poe poem,
written in the days before he realised that ravens are scarier than sheds.

“Hey, shed guy!” the adverts scream. “Remember those sheds you looked at the
other week? They’re still here! Look how boxy and mundane they still are. Come
on, click it. Click the shed.”

Behavioural retargeting [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting],
this is called. Chances are you’ve encountered it, too. Maybe you once went on
Amazon, purely to see whether the word “Singalongamax
[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Singalongamax-Max-Bygraves/dp/B00000854Y]” had hyphens
in it or not, and now you can’t move for Max Bygraves adverts. Maybe you ordered
your partner a NutriBullet for her birthday, and every site you subsequently
visited carried an advert for NutriBullets, and you had to fling a coat over
your screen every time she came in the room in case it ruined the surprise, and
now she’s convinced that you suffer from a crippling porn addiction. Behavioural
retargeting is everywhere, and it’s infuriating.

The easy way out would be for everyone to just install an adblocker
[http://www.theguardian.com/media/ad-blocking] and be done with it. Certainly,
that’s what people are doing in their droves – it’s been estimated that up to a
quarter of adults use them.

But this is where I have to draw a line in the sand, because I’m not a monster.
If I use a site – any site: a news site or a forum or social media – it’s
because it has some worth to me, and I don’t want to see it go anywhere. That’s
what adverts are for. You put up with a peripheral banner telling you how funny
The Book of Mormon is, and the site gets paid as a result. But when you install
an adblocker, you remove this revenue stream and the sites you like begin to
suffer. By installing an adblocker, you’re actively contributing to the
reduction of the internet. If you install an adblocker, one day everything you
enjoy will be replaced by three rotating Facebook clickthrough galleries
entitled The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Presents 21 Funny Faces
That Dogs Pull When They’re Horny, and you’ll have nobody to blame but yourself.

The problem I have isn’t so much with adverts themselves, but with the specific
adverts that follow you around from site to site like a wounded puppy, tugging
on your trouser leg until you finally put it out of its misery. Before it was
sheds, it was coats. Before it was coats, it was coffee tables. I’m also being
stalked by a pair of shoes that I looked at once, and now bloodlessly creep into
my Facebook stream at every opportunity. They’re nice shoes, too, but I refuse
to buy them as a matter of principle. If those shoes ever go near my feet, the
internet will have won and I’ll be no better than a child.

Marketers know how infuriating retargeting is, too. In 2014, researchers 
performed a study
[http://www.inskinmedia.com/blog/retargeted-ads-put-half-people-buying/] into
retargeting, and found that people generally get more annoyed the more they see
an ad for something they had previously looked at online. They overwhelmingly
said that the adverts made them angry and, if they ever happened to see an
advert for something they had already bought, they instantly became four times
more likely to never buy it again.

Clearly, retargeting has its upsides – if they didn’t increase sales on some
level they wouldn’t exist, plus it’s now easier than ever to sweep through your
office, clock everyone’s retargeted banner ads and make a discreet inventory of
all the perverts who’ve ever thought about buying adult-sized Peppa Pig duvet
covers – but the downsides vastly outnumber them. If they annoy people so much
that they would rather install an adblocker and choke their favourite sites to
death in the process, then something needs to be done.

Luckily, something can be done. There’s a little blue triangle in the corner of
these adverts. Click it, and you’ll be able to opt-out of most retargeted ads.
You’ll still see adverts, but they won’t be the same creepily omnipresent ads
that would otherwise haunt your every move. And that’s a win-win. You stop
feeling like you’re being stalked by a shed, the site still makes money and
nobody has to make the uncomfortable decision to install an adblocker. You’re
just left with the perfect, undiluted web experience you always wanted. Good

Didn’t Know Were Jewish” sponsored-link galleries clogging up the bottom of
every single article you ever read. Perfect.","Opinion","2016-06-14T11:03:25Z","I’m being chased around the internet by a shed | Stuart Heritage","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/14/im-being-chased-around-the-internet-by-a-shed"
"technology/2014/oct/05/cookies-crumbled-internet-anonymity","The old adage “if the service is free, then you are its product” needs updating.
What it signified was that web services (like Facebook, Google, Yahoo et al)
that do not charge users make their money by harvesting personal and behavioural
data relating to those users and selling that data to advertisers. That’s still
true, of course. But a more accurate version of the adage would now read
something like this: if you use the web for anything (including paying for
stuff) then you are also the product, because your data is being sold on to
third parties without your knowledge.

In a way, you probably already knew this. A while back you searched for, say, a
digital camera on the John Lewis site. And then you noticed that wherever you
went on the web after that John Lewis ads for cameras kept appearing on the site
you were visiting. What you were witnessing was the output of a
multibillion-dollar industry that operates below the surface of the web. Think
of it as the hidden wiring of our networked world. And what it does is track you
wherever you go online.

Here’s how it works. When you click on an organisation’s web page, in addition
to the page content it will also contain invisible Javascript programs which are
there for the sole purpose of tracking your browsing habits. In the old days,
tracking was done with “cookies” – strings of text placed on your computer’s
hard drive by websites with the (legitimate) aim of improving the “user
experience” or site performance
[https://www.isecpartners.com/research/white-papers/cleaning-up-after-cookies.aspx]
. But abuse of cookies eventually led to a backlash via data-protection law and
users deleting them, and so their efficacy as trackers was reduced.

Predictably new generations of trackers then emerged. The most pernicious is
probably the Flash cookie maintained by the Adobe Flash plug-in. According to
the Electronic Frontier Foundation briefing
[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/new-cookie-technologies-harder-see-and-remove-wide] 
on these, Flash cookies are stored outside the browser’s control and users
cannot view or delete them. Nor are users notified when the cookies (which have
no expiry date) are set. Flash cookies can track users in all the ways
traditional old-style cookies do, but they can be stored or retrieved whenever a
user accesses a page containing a Flash application – which is almost every page
that most people access.

As the Economist recently reported in a major study
[http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21615871-everything-people-do-online-avidly-followed-advertisers-and-third-party?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/gettingtoknowyou]
, the scale of tracking is staggering, and it’s now done in real time. One
advertising executive told the Economist that “his firm has the chance to bid
for around 10m online advertising ‘impressions’ (ads seen by a user) every
second”. Data brokerage (for that is what this industry calls itself) has
evolved from being a table look-up business to something akin to high-frequency
trading in the stock market. Even as you browse a web page, an invisible
computerised auction is going on somewhere to decide what ads you should see.

If you want to get a sense of what drives this, install the Ghostery plug-in
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/] for your browser and
then go and visit some of the sites you normally access. I’ve just looked up one
at random – reed.co.uk, which describes itself as “the UK’s #1 job site”. It has
10 trackers at the landing-page level, but when you search for particular jobs
in a particular location the number of trackers explodes. A search for “software
architect” in Cambridge, for example, produces a page with 28 trackers.

The conventional happy talk from the internet and advertising industries is that
this kind of data hoovering is unproblematic because your real identity is not
being disclosed. But the rise of social media has upended that applecart. It’s
trivially easy now to correlate browsing data with, say, Facebook profiles or
other online sources. For example, Latanya Sweeney of Harvard long ago
established that 87% of the people in the US can be identified
[http://aboutmyinfo.org/] via just three data points – age, sex and postcode.

There’s an extraordinary cover story in this month’s Wired magazine
[http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine] by Madhumita Venkataramanan which makes this
point vividly. It starts with a long and very detailed account of a person –
occupation, interests, culinary tastes, travel, family background, income,
charitable donations, marital status, house-cleaning arrangements, etc. And then
she writes: “This motley set of characteristics, thoughts and attitudes comes
very close to defining me as a person. It’s also a precise and accurate
description of what a group of companies – personal data-trackers – has learned
about me.”","Technology","2014-10-04T23:05:01Z","When the cookies crumbled, so did your web anonymity","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/05/cookies-crumbled-internet-anonymity"
"media/2013/jul/11/last-fm-lumi-stiksel-miller-web-recommendation","The co-founders of music recommendation site Last.fm are launch a new discovery
service today, using 10 years of experience around recommendation tools to
develop Lumi.do [https://lumi.do/join].

Initially a browser plugin for Chrome and Firefox, Lumi uses the browsing
history to suggest related content including news, arts, sport and
entertainment. 

Consumers have come to negatively associate cookies - small files that
cumulatively create a browsing history – with having their activity tracked, but
cookies also allow services to be targeted, relevant and useful, says Stiksel. 

""I've been browsing the web for 15 years and I've got nothing to show for it,""
he said. ""It's that same Last.fm principle of using data that people have lying
around, in this case to help them discover new things. They understand that
their data is valuable and normally it is used in a commercial environment being
used by advertisers, but they don't know what else can be done with it.""

Lumi doesn't collect user data but presents different suggestions based on their
local browsing history, so results improve and update as the user keeps
browsing. A side menu offers more tailored options for certain subjects.

It's four years since the pair last worked at Last.fm following the acquisition.
""There are different challenges working in a corporate environment to a startup,
yes,"" said Miller. But they reject that in their absensce, Last.fm is flagging
[http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/04/last-fm-reports-loss] and has been
usurped by Spotify. ""All the music was always available anyway, and Last.fm
links well into Spotify – a playlist jumping off point. But Last.fm made Spotify
realise they needed to do something in recommendation.""

Stiksel and Miller both admit they were not looking for another startup project
– Miller described running a startup as ""a pain in the arse"" – but they had
identified a need for more intelligent web browsing and felt their Last.fm
experience meant they were best placed to do it. 

Given that CBS paid $280m (£142m) for Last.fm in 2007, it's no surprise that
building revenue is not a priority for Lumi at the moment, though the potential
for informed, contextualised information, particularly around brands and retail,
seems obvious. 

For the small team of nine, the focus is to build the service out beyond the
trial userbase of 10,000 people. The next challenge will be to build for mobile
devices, where most data is inaccessible and couldn't be used to customise
Lumi's results.

After that, there's even scope for a smart TV app, said Miller. ""There's a need
for a more tangible stream of content on screen and better way to navigate all
that,"" he said. ""Maybe you come home from work and want a few minutes of content
delivered to you rather than having to go to websites or filter thousands of
tweets. Very much a lean-back experience.""

""We spent 11 years on Last.fm, and everything we did on that site was derived
from real human activity created by a real person. That was the underlying theme
and the most powerful thing about recommendation. It's the commonsense
approach.""","Technology","2013-07-11T13:01:00Z","Last.fm founders launch web recommendation tool Lumi","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/11/last-fm-lumi-stiksel-miller-web-recommendation"
"technology/2012/apr/13/new-law-cookies-affect-internet-browsing","Click to discover how the Guardian uses cookies [#] We are being watched. The
websites we visit, and the advertisers who promote products on those sites, are
tracking our online activity, building a profile of where we go and in some
cases what we do when we get there.

The computer on which this article is being written has no fewer than 2,901
tracking files (known as cookies) monitoring its online activity, from sites
including Google (121 cookies), Amazon (14), the UK government (46) and dozens
upon dozens of advertising networks. These track different things: some monitor
which sites are visited, some track which adverts are clicked, others store and
report back on preferences and favourites on different sites.

The Guardian site is no exception. Unless your browser's security settings are
particularly high – and most users' aren't – the Guardian will have placed
several cookies on your computer as you arrived at this article, and its
advertisers will have placed a few of their own.

Given virtually every internet user will have hundreds of cookies, and other
forms of tracking, on their computer, and only a small proportion will be aware
of this fact, cookies present a privacy concern for visitors and site owners.

This may be less sinister than it might first seem. Most cookies store no
identifying information on a user: they are interested only in the behaviour of
the person behind the computer, not their identity. Those that do track an
identity are usually tied to login functions or preferences on one particular
website.

Still, the concern of pressure groups and users was enough to warrant the EU to
look into the issue, and enough to compel it to take action. From 26 May this
year, every website operating in the UK will be required to inform its users
that they are being tracked with cookies, and to ask users for their consent
[http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=3].

Sites which do not comply with the new rules face fines of up to £500,000,
levied by the information commissioner.

This means sites will have to justify why they need information on their users –
explaining which aspects of the sites they use rely on cookies.

Leaving advertising aside, cookies fill three major roles on the Guardian's own
site, as GNM product manager Piers Jones explains:

""Cookies do a great job at remembering users' preferences,"" he says. ""If you
want to change your default view from the US to UK site, or vice versa, cookies
store that preference. Another use is whether you want to see the full site or
mobile site from your phone. Cookies also power accessibility options and
identity across the site, including on the comment system.""

Cookies are also used for user testing across the Guardian – when new components
are added to the site, there's often no way to know in advance what way of
displaying it would work best. Cookies allow a random sample of site visitors to
see it one way, and a different group another. Site administrators can then
track which view gets the best response.

The third use for cookies is for tracking how a site is used to fuel
improvements to it, getting a larger pool of data than focus groups or similar
would generate:

""From my perspective, we're trying to look at the experience people have on the
site,"" says Jones. ""Without these cookies, that becomes harder to do.""

Internet tracking is also essential for targeting ads delivered by the big
advertising networks, and without such cookies sites relying on these for
revenue could be adversely affected.

""Cookies ID you when you're on a particular PC and let ad networks build up a
profile. This means when you go to another site on the network they build a much
deeper ad profile, which means more relevant, and therefore higher priced,
adverts can be delivered,"" explains Ian Maude of Enders Analysis. ""The new rules
don't spell the death of internet advertising, but could be a handicap to some
sites.""

Maude adds that sites which have login information on their users can build far
deeper profiles of their userbase than even cookies allow, and these would
remain unaffected by legal changes. This means sites such as Google (for
logged-in users) and Facebook's advertising would be untouched, as would that of
the Financial Times and similar sites.

For large sites such as the Guardian, where some advertising is sold directly by
advertising teams and the remainder delivered through networks, there could
potentially be an effect, but it could be smaller sites that are hardest hit.

""Sites with a weak relationship with their audience may struggle, especially if
advertising networks are the only way they target their ads. Overall growth in
the advertising market should offset the decline, but not for all sites.""

How websites follow the new rules may have a big impact. Some, such as the 
information commissioner's site [http://www.ico.gov.uk/], explicitly asks users
to tick a box agreeing to accept cookies. Early anecdotal evidence suggests this
can reduce the number of users accepting tracking by more than 90%. Other sites,
such as bt.com [http://www.bt.com/], display a prominent message asking users if
they wish to change settings, and saying the default will be to accept
everything if not – which experts believe will mean a far smaller portion of
users will refuse tracking.

Most sites – including the Guardian – haven't yet revealed how they intend to
respond to the changes in law. But however it's done, prominent websites across
the UK may find themselves having to explain and justify monitoring they've
previously taken for granted – and their future success may depend on how well
they do so.

[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/13/tracking-the-trackers-cookies-web-monitors]
has since last Friday asked users of the site to submit anonymised information
on the webpages they visit and the tracking files (usually known as ""cookies"")
that those sites place.

Since then, more than 300 users have uploaded information on the relationships
between more than 16,000 websites and cookies, building one of the most detailed
databases ever available on the prevelance of web cookies.

The project is still accepting new data, but has published the current top 10
tracking files on the internet, in order to begin investigating what information
each tracks, and which companies are behind them. It's given below, with the
number of websites that attempted to place the cookie on users' computers:

1. doubleclick.net (863 sites)

2. quantserve.com (531 sites)

3. scorecardresearch.com (507 sites)

4. facebook.com (488 sites)

5. twitter.com (378 sites)

6. google.com (306 sites)

7. addthis.com (275 sites)

8. adnxs.com (233 sites)

9. yieldmanager.com (198 sites)

10. imrworldwide.com (188 sites)

Some of the most prolific cookies clearly come from well-known internet
companies such as Google or Facebook, while others come from their subsidiaries:
Doubleclick.net, the most prolific cookie discovered to date, is one of the
biggest advertising providers on the internet, and is owned by Google.

Others in the top 10 list come from providers who most internet users will never
have heard of. The Guardian is investigating who is behind each, what
information they track, and for what purposes.

The Guardian has encouraged its users to help the investigation by downloading a
free application called Collusion, built by Mozilla (the company behind the
open-source browser Firefox). It works by showing you the sites you've visited
and what tracking devices they set on your computer.

Just a few minutes surfing the web can result in a string of company names,
products and services unknown outside the worlds of online advertising and
analytics, which users were then asked to submit anonymously to the Guardian for
research.

This anonymous data will eventually be published by the Guardian, to allow any
developers and users – rather than just those within the big advertisers – to
build a true picture of tracking on the net.

The initial findings of the study come as new research from privacy consultancy
TRUSTe suggested that UK websites are not doing enough to safeguard their users'
privacy. TRUSTe's figures suggested that the average large UK website placed 14
tracking files on each user's computer, most of which were from third parties,
usually advertisers.

One third of privacy policies revealed user data automatically shared with third
parties for commercial purposes, while almost half tracked location data of
their users. The typical privacy policy was 2,299 words long – twice a typical's
Queen's speech and half the length of the Magna Carta, making them inaccessible
for users, TRUSTe warned.

""Clearly, more work needs to be done to deliver shorter, more accessible privacy
notices that can be easily understood by consumers so that they can make
informed choices around their personal information,"" said CEO Chris Babel.

"money/2012/mar/30/internet-cookie-crunch-online-shopping","Delia Smith is having trouble with her cookies – and we don't mean her
delicious-sounding chocolate almond ones.

If you log on to the TV chef's Delia Online websiteto check out her ""recipe of
the day"", or pick up some cooking tips, you will be confronted with a big pop-up
window stating: ""Important notice to Delia Online users … the law now states
that cookies on websites can only be used with your specific consent. Delia
Online is currently formulating the best way to obtain your consent without
compromising your enjoyment of the site."" You have to actively click on the
pop-up to get rid of it so that you can access the site's content.

Meanwhile, anyone visiting the website of South Ayrshire council
[http://www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk/] in Scotland can't fail to notice the large
blue information bar at the top of the homepage. Headed ""Important: Cookie
Policy"", this includes a button allowing people to accept the use of cookies.

As you will have gathered by now, this issue involves internet cookies rather
than the edible kind, and new European Union rules dictating the way they can be
used.

Cookies are small data files put on to our computers by websites so they can
remember things about us, and almost every site uses them (see opposite).

On 26 May last year, the law on the use of cookies changed. Companies usually
bury information about cookies in a link labelled ""privacy policy"" in small type
at the bottom of their homepage. But from that date, all UK businesses and
organisations running websites in this country were required to obtain people's
consent before they install cookies on their machines. These rules are designed
to protect our privacy, and were partly prompted by concern about the online
tracking of individuals and the use of ""spyware"" to collect information.

However, in an 11th-hour intervention, the UK authorities gave everyone 12
months to implement the new rules. Some website bosses may have been hoping the
whole thing would go away, but, unfortunately for them, this ""grace period"" ends
on 26 May. From that date, all firms and organisations using cookies must comply
with the law. Any website flouting the rules could face enforcement action from
the Information Commissioner's Office [http://www.ico.gov.uk/] (ICO), which has
the power to impose fines of up to £500,000.

One of the problems for websites is that the ICO hasn't proposed a
""one-size-fits-all"" solution for seeking people's permission to use cookies.
Some websites may go for a message bar at the top or bottom of the screen;
others might go for a pop-up window. Many companies will probably do nothing.
Some may even take the view that they would rather risk a fine than meddle with
""the user experience"", which could lead to their advertising revenue taking a
big hit.

Some experts say the new rules could have a big impact if someone is looking at
lots of different websites they have no relationship with.

For example, you might be indulging in a spot of online shopping during your
lunch hour. You are browsing 10 or 20 online retailers looking for the best
price, but every time you visit a new site, you are confronted with a warning
notice, pop-up or ""splash page"" informing you about how cookies are used on the
site, and asking for your consent, when all you want to do is quickly check the
cost of something. Fed up with being plagued by pop-ups and the like, you
abandon your search.

The above scenario shows why this is such a big deal for websites, and brings us
back to Delia Smith. To be fair to the celebrity chef and South Ayrshire
council, they are virtually alone in publicly and prominently acknowledging the
cookie issue on their websites. When Guardian Money looked at several major UK
sites this week – Google [http://www.google.co.uk/], Amazon
[http://www.amazon.co.uk/], eBay [http://www.ebay.co.uk/], HSBC
[http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/], Rightmove [http://www.rightmove.co.uk/], 
TripAdvisor [http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/] (and the Guardian
[http://www.theguardian.com/]) and so on – it found that none had prominently
displayed information about cookies on their homepages.

An article published last month on the EzineArticles.com site
[http://ezinearticles.com/?Is-Anybody-Compliant-With-the-EU-Cookie-Law-Yet?&id=6881539] 
claimed that when more than 17,000 UK sites were analysed, only 53 were found to
be EU compliant.

It appears everyone is playing their cards close to their chest and waiting for
someone else to make the first move. David Evans at the ICO concedes that with
just weeks to go, there are ""very few examples"" of companies and organisations
that have gone live with a solution, but insists: ""People are moving in the
right direction.""

One of the big debates in the industry has been about what type of permission
you need to obtain from internet users. The ICO says: ""Consent must involve some
form of communication where the individual knowingly indicates their acceptance.
This may involve clicking an icon, sending an email or subscribing to a
service.""

The bad news for websites is that the ICO guidance suggests they can't, for the
moment, rely on ""implied consent"" – where there is a notice about cookies on the
site which you can effectively ignore, and when you carry on browsing, this is
interpreted as you giving your permission for cookies to be used.

However, there is a growing view in the web community that, provided a site has
a clear policy on cookies and some kind of notice up on its homepage, this will
probably be enough to satisfy the UK authorities.

When Money spoke to the ICO, it pointed us in the direction of a website that
has come up with a solution it likes. The site is operated by a web design
company called Reddbridge Media [http://www.reddbridge.co.uk/]. When you visit
its site, there is a notice at the top of the homepage telling users that by
clicking on any part of the page, ""you are giving your consent for us to set our
optional cookies"". That seems very much like implied rather than explicit
consent.

However, the ICO made it clear to us that the Reddbridge Media approach wouldn't
be appropriate for those websites using more intrusive ""third-party cookies"",
such as those which deliver tailored advertisements to a site's visitors. These
ads are usually based on what you have been looking at. For these websites,
getting consent for those cookies will be more tricky, says the ICO.

Some privacy campaigners believe more websites should follow the example of
South Ayrshire council and have a button or tick-box allowing people to actively
accept cookies. The trouble is, research has shown that
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/29/most_users_would_not_accept_cookies/] 
if you offer a facility of this type, most visitors to a site – around 90% –
don't ""opt in"". If only 10% of visitors allowed themselves to be tracked, that
would be a disaster for many retailers and other businesses, as it means the
site wouldn't know how many people are visiting and which adverts they are
clicking on.

One household-name website told us: ""The vast majority of people will say no [to
cookies] if you give them the opportunity. It would be lovely to deliver an
opt-in, but we are realistic that it would result in a huge loss in advertising
revenue.""

Perhaps not surprisingly, the companies Money spoke to were saying very little
on the record. For example, when we asked Amazon what changes it is planning to
make to its UK website to ensure it is compliant with the law, it sent us a
short statement saying: ""We comply with all applicable laws and will take all
necessary steps to comply with any changes in the law.""

And what about the Guardian's website? ""We are in the process of testing our
approach with small user groups to see how they react,"" said a spokesman. Money
was told that users of the Guardian site ""will notice a difference"". There is no
date yet for that, but it will be before 26 May.","Money","2012-03-30T22:01:14Z","Internet cookie crunch on the way for online shoppers","https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/30/internet-cookie-crunch-online-shopping"

logged by tracking files from Google, Twitter, Doubleclick (Google's advertising
network), Facebook, Quantcast, Nielsen and Appnexus – and that's nothing
unusual. While advertising is not the only reason for tracking (it's also used
to help remember logins, to improve websites, and for audience research) it's a
major motivation – and also a bet many websites are relying on for their future.

Web advertising is much, much cheaper than its TV or print equivalent. For many
companies, this means that the shift online is met with precipitously falling
revenues. Trying to increase the value of online advertising is, therefore,
central to the strategy of many sites online. User tracking helps this in two
ways: firstly, it fixes the basic mechanics of tracking which adverts get
clicked, and how often. The second method, though, is the key one.

Most websites you visit have no idea who you are (assuming you don't have a
login), but they want to be able to serve you an advert you might actually be
interested in, for a product you might actually buy. That way, visitors to the
site are less likely to be annoyed by inappropriate ads, and advertisers to the
site are more likely to pay higher rates, for successful campaigns. Tracking
facilitates this through a series of educated guesses: if you've visited a group
of travel sites, adverts for holidays or travel insurance might work. If you're
googling ""divorce"", then lawyers (or offshoring experts) might be more in line.
The website still has very little idea who you are, but through the glimpses of
your online history it's seen, it makes a best guess at which of its adverts
might be best for you.

It's a hit-and-miss process which at the moment, frankly, usually misses. But
better handling of user data and tracking, and the better adverts that would
result, is the great hope of most websites looking to make money from free and
open access.

Users, however, are often less happy with the arrangement. Benign or not, many
feel an aversion to being tracked, and a concern the process is out of our
control. Privacy settings on the browser make it possible to block these
tracking files, but though not complex, this is beyond the experience of many
users. Furthermore, it makes using many sites which rely on these files
(Facebook, online shopping, webmail, and more) a more difficult process.

In the UK, the law has recently changed to make sites more open about how they
track their users – a guide to how the Guardian tracks its users is here
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/13/new-law-cookies-affect-internet-browsing] 
– requiring sites to give their users notification their site uses tracking
files, and a chance to opt in or out of such measures, or else face penalties.

Users choosing to opt out of this information economy face a dilemma, though.
Ultimately, at least some degree of tracking is required to make ad-supported
websites work. While most sites now rely on funding from a variety of sources
(paid sections, freemium, and more), advertising is the overwhelming majority of
revenue for most – including Google and Facebook. If the advertising model
collapses online, there are two alternatives remaining: paying for the services
a site offers, or letting it shut.

For online consumers of information, entertainment and news it's time to stand
and deliver: your money or your (online) life. Which – if any – would you be
most willing to hand over, and how much of either? And if the answer's neither,
how else can the web look to keep itself afloat?

"voluntary-sector-network/2012/aug/24/cookies-law-for-charities","A cookie is the name given to the information tags that are stored on computers
and mobile devices by third parties. They act like digital bread crumbs, Hansel
and Gretel-style, to gather and store information about how people use their
devices. There are four different types of cookies:

STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES
Some cookies are essential in order to allow people to make use of features, for
example logging in and staying logged in as they move through the various
different pages of a website They are necessary for the website to work
properly.

FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES
Others cookies are desirable because they enhance the experience people get, for
example cookies that remember previous choices when filling an online form –
these are not strictly necessary, but helpful .

PERFORMANCE COOKIES
They monitor the performance of a website, for example number of views each page
gets, how long people stay on a particular page, etc .

TARGETING AND ADVERTISING COOKIES
Finally, there are 'Big Brother' type cookies used to collect people's detailed
information in order to carry out targeted advertising.

The new cookies law is actually an update to the Privacy and Electronic
Communications Regulations 2003
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/contents/made]. Since the law
passed there was an obligation to tell people if you use cookies , but from 26
May 2011 the new cookies law required anyone using them to inform web users
upfront.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) [http://www.ico.gov.uk/],
responsible for enforcing data protection rules in the UK, set a year long
compliance deadline which has just expired. Predictably, many left it to the
last minute, giving rise to that late May frenzy.

If you put any cookies onto people's devices, there are two key elements to
compliance: you must provide clear and comprehensive information about the
purposes of the storage of, or access to, the information that will be stored by
the cookie and the user must have given you his or her consent. Consent is not
defined in the regulations and the ICO have stressed that different
organisations will come up with different solutions. Consent is not required for
strictly necessary cookies; for the other cookies the method of obtaining
consent is decided according to how intrusive the cookie is.

As a first step, you should conduct a cookie audit and identify the cookies that
you've got. They will be a mix of yours and third parties (eg, Google Analytics
[http://www.google.com/analytics/]). Next look at your privacy policy to make
sure your cookies wording is clear, easy to understand wording. Include a table
of cookies, identifying the cookie type from the four categories above. Then
decide on how to deal with consent.

Pop-up windows to get consent are a safe bet for compliance, but evidence
suggests website use drops dramatically (including at the ICO!). Getting consent
through terms and conditions and privacy policy also works, but only if people
are agree to them. A more subtle approach is specific notices placed on the
website indicating that cookies are used – which is what most have decided to
do. This is the least offensive option to people visiting your website – and
gives a better chance of that person having a positive interaction and thus
staying and donating.

The ICO recently indicated that implied consent will be valid as long as the
organisation is satisfied that people will understand that their actions will
result in cookies being set, although some situations, such as the collection of
personal health information, may lead website owners to feel that explicit
consent is required. Charities encourage online donations, and rely heavily on
well-designed websites to raise their profiles and collect donations. Charities
need to assess how effective their online campaigns have been. The inability to
place cookies without obtaining consent will affect their ability to do this.

Formal undertakings and enforcement notices are the ICO's preferred method of
enforcement and monetary penalties will only be issued in the most serious cases
of non-compliance where people have suffered damage. The ICO is not (generally)
heavy handed and seeks to obtain compliance by consent. The approach should
essentially be this: look at what you are doing, have a plan, be transparent
about that and don't get sidetracked by what others are doing – every site is
unique!

"technology/2012/apr/23/adnxs-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS ADNXS.COM?
Adnxs.com is run by AppNexus [http://www.appnexus.com/], a company that provides
technology, data and analytics to help companies buy and sell online display
advertising.

The technology it uses can plug into other advertising serving platforms, such
as Google's Doubleclick, and ""data aggregators"", such as Quantcast, which
provide behavioural targeting. In essence, this makes AppNexus an an
""advertising exchange for advertising exchanges"".

AppNexus offers a number of different services
[http://info.evidon.com/companies/appnexus?ecaid=0&n=380], including:

Ad exchange 
An auction marketplace where advertisers can bid for ad slots on certain
websites.

Data aggregator/supplier 
The company collects data from a range of online and sometimes offline sources
and provides data to advertisers directly or via its exchange.

Demand-side platform 
Technology provider that enables advertisers to buy ad inventory from other ad
exchanges.

WHAT INFORMATION IS APPNEXUS TRACKING?
The company says it uses cookies and web beacons to build groups of users
(segments) that are used to target advertising.

It is not entirely clear from AppNexus's website or privacy policy under what
circumstances someone is likely to have an AppNexus cookie set on their browser.
However, it is not too wild an assumption to make that the cookie is set when a
browser visits websites that use the AppNexus service or related ad exchanges.

Web beacons may also appear on these websites and work in conjunction with the
cookies to identify the types of pages a browser is visiting. It is also
possible that web beacons may be included in advertising that is using the
AppNexus service to provide data about the success of the adverts and whether
browsers who clicked on adverts then went on to buy anything.

According to its page on cookies [http://www.appnexus.com/cookies ], information
that may be tracked about about a browser include: 

- a unique identifier (so a browser can be recognised when it appears on another
website using AppNexus' services).
- what adverts the browser has seen.
- what page the browser was on when they saw the advert.
- when the browser saw the advert.
- whether the advert has been clicked or not.
- what type of pages the browser has visited (to build up an idea of what
content might be used).
- IP Address (to infer location).

IS THE DATA SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES?
On AppNexus' website, it mentions that it allows customers to match data that
has been collected through the company's services with data from other services.

This is the complicated world of cookie matching – where two services will share
the same ID for a browser
[http://www.mikeonads.com/2010/02/22/rtb-part-iii-cookies-user-data/]. 

AppNexus says it only shares data when it is aggregated into a report or when
required by law (this is the same for all organisations that store data).

IS THE DATA EVER MATCHED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
No, says AppNexus.

HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED BY APPNEXUS?
Data obtained by AppNexus are owned by their customers. Any data in the platform
is retained in non-aggregated form for up to 12 months. Aggregated data, which
AppNexus uses to create reports and analysis, may be stored for up to three
years.

"technology/blog/2008/jun/25/withphorminthewingsusisp","Phorm, the server-side adware company, is poised to begin its next trial to
provide ads based on peoples' internet browsing to a limited number of opt-in
customers using BT Broadband: we hear that it will start imminently, perhaps
even this week.

But while it's caused a privacy storm here in the UK (with some protesters
planning to picket BT's annual shareholder meeting) - see our coverage here
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/06/internet.privacy] and here
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/apr/03/privacy.telecoms] (and listen
to the interview
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2008/mar/11/charles.arthur.phorm] 
with Phorm's CEO and chair, Kent Ertugrul) - there's also been moves to
introduce similar systems in the US.

Thus Charter Communications, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US,
quietly said in May that it would trial systems from NebuAd, which uses a
similar system to Phorm: it invisibly tracks what web pages you request,
analyses the header and some of the text, and then tries to figure out what
you're generally interested in finding out.

Now Charter is backtracking: the trial has been put off, and ""privacy concerns""
are being cited.

Quoth
[http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN2540003120080625] the
Charter PR:

""As we do with all new service launches or initiatives, we conducted focus
groups well in advance, which told us that most broadband consumers would look
upon this service favorably,"" Charter said on Wednesday. 

""However, some of our customers have presented questions about this service as
well as suggested improvements,"" it said. ""We will continue to take a
thoughtful, deliberate approach with the goal to ultimately structure an
advertising service that enhances the internet experience for our customers and
addresses questions and concern they've raised."" 

Put that way, it all sounds like everyone was so pleased, obviously they had to
delay it. Can't be pleasing people too much.

The reality though is that US legislators had kicked up a storm, prompted by
privacy advocates: ""The fact is that it would have allowed profiling of an
individual - where they were going and what they were doing online, and there
was no guarantee that this information could not ultimately be compromised,"" Ed
Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts who chairs the House of Representatives
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet, told
the Washington Post
[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/24/AR2008062401033.html]
. ""They made the right decision in halting their test.""

NebuAd has been accused of forging Google data packets
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/23/topolski_takes_on_nebuad/]. The packets
had extra Javascript code in them which loaded data from another page. (This
sort of diversion is bad: if there weren't a company you trusted behind it,
you'd conclude that your router or machine might be compromised. Which is what
happened when BT did its early - quite feasibly illegal - trials of the Phorm
system. Phorm has since changed its system so it doesn't inject Javascript.)

And the other part of the reality is that Charter doesn't know when it's going
to restart the scheme. That comes perilously close to ""dropping"" it, you have to
think.

Now, Phorm has insisted repeatedly that its system means that people can't
profile you; if someone breaks into its database, all they'd find is a set of
unique IDs, web pages pre-defined ad channel match, and times, but nothing with
IP addresses or names or emails that could link the ID to a person.

Will that be enough, though, if similar ideas are being put off in the US, where
privacy online isn't usually as strongly defended at the individual level (and
is certainly not as enshrined in the law as in the UK and Europe)?

familiar.)

"media/blog/2011/apr/25/cookies-net-neutrality","Sometimes the ways of the European Commission are simply too mystifying to
fathom. What is one to make of an organisation which in one week decides that
cookies – little text files that sit on your web browser and relate where you've
gone online (but which you can control quickly and easily via preferences on
your machine) must be regulated as though they were an outbreak of Ebola fever,
but says there's no need to impose ""net neutrality"" duties
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/19/eu-internet-neutrality-legislation] 
on telecoms companies?

The importance of the two matters is vastly different. Cookies really aren't the
end of the world. Net neutrality, or the absence of it, might be – or it could
be the end of a digital startup's ambitions to become the next YouTube. The
uncharitable view would be that the cookie-planters are bad at lobbying, and
that the telecoms companies fared much better at knocking on European
commissioner Neelie Kroes's door and saying ""Neelie, could we have a minute?"".

The cookies thing? Let's go over that. The EC has determined that ""explicit
consent"" must be obtained from ""every site visitor"" to install a cookie on their
machine. Many people think this might mean something like a popup consent form.
This would be a nightmare for all sorts of people, but most of all for you and
me, the user. Have you ever tried navigating around a website (or the web) with
the preference on your browser set to ""Ask me before accepting cookies""? It's
like being stopped by every single person who passes you on the street, if the
street were London's Oxford Street. On the last shopping day before Christmas.

Sites set cookies for all sorts of reasons: to show you've logged in, to track
if you've visited, to keep your shopping cart stocked. And yes, to serve
adverts. The EC directive (which communications minister Ed Vaizey is
desperately trying to make calming noises about) will affect pay-per-click
advertisers and users of Google Analytics. Pretty much every European website
will be affected, including guardian.co.uk.

Are cookies bad? No, they're useful. Alex Sharratt of Impact Media puts it well:
concerns over cookies as privacy-busters are like the worries over the Large
Hadron Collider imploding the Earth into a black hole. Attention-grabbing, but
absurd. Vaizey is trying to find a way of implementing the directive yet not
causing total disruption to the internet business in the UK. And good luck to
him.

But net neutrality is a real issue. Imagine you have a brilliant video startup
that relies on pumping gigabytes of data at high speed over networks to
consumers. The sheer cost of bandwidth is bad enough – but internet service
providers give you pained smiles and say you'll have to pay extra, or that
high-speed video just isn't going to reach their customers. Without net
neutrality, that's a realistic scenario.

Kroes's (and Vaizey's) answer is not to worry – ISPs would be obliged to tell
you if they do this. And then everyone would arise en masse and leave their ISP
for another one. If, that is, they disapproved. This is nonsense. Look how much
trouble people have shifting to the best-interest bank accounts – and that's
about money, not some web service. Vaizey was told as much
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/16/tim-berners-lee-net-neutrality] 
when the idea was floated at a net neutrality meeting in London with ISPs and
content producers. The fact Sir Tim Berners-Lee favours net neutrality should be
a clue which side to fight on.

Why can't the EC see that net neutrality is one thing that will really make a
difference to indigenous startups? It removes barriers to success, rather than
putting them in the way of everyone. Maybe it is down to that lobbying
differential. Loads of small companies rely on cookies. A few big ones don't
want net neutrality. And look what happens.

Is it too much to ask that Kroes will come to her senses? She has a team looking
at mobile operators' neutrality, or lack of it – though she doesn't think that's
a problem either, nor that safeguards are needed. For consumers, it's a world of
hurt.","Media","2011-04-25T06:00:06Z","Let the cookie crumble and give us net neutrality","https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/apr/25/cookies-net-neutrality"
"technology/2010/oct/01/eu-online-privacy","The European commission is taking the UK government to court for breaching
European Union laws on internet privacy.

The court action follows complaints made by broadband users to the UK
Information Commissioner relating to the secret use of Phorm activity-tracking
software monitoring users' online habits, an experiment BT dropped in 2009
[http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/btgroup-privacy-and-the-net] 
after tests in 2006 and 2007.

But BT has now said that it is ""simply inaccurate"" to link the court action to
the company. The telecoms operator hit back at reports linking the commission's
investigation to the company's experiment tracking the online habits of
customers in order to target them with relevant advertising.

""The potential infraction proceedings relate to an alleged mis-implementation of
EU law by the UK government. As such, they are a matter for the EU and the UK
government. It is simply inaccurate to describe them as relating in any way to
BT,"" the company said.

The European commission twice wrote to the UK government in 2009 asking it to
change privacy laws under the Regulation of Investigator Powers Act (RIPA) and
the Data Protection Act (DPA). The commission has now said it will use court
action to force the UK government to more fully implement the Privacy and
Electronic Communications Directive and the Data Protection Directive.

The commission yesterday said: ""The commission considers that existing UK law
governing the confidentiality of electronic communications is in breach of the
UK's obligations under the ePrivacy Directive and the Data Protection
Directive.""

BT, the UK's largest broadband provider, attracted controversy for testing
technology developed by Phorm that tracked the habits of customers in order to
increase the relevancy of advertising it serves. It subsequently dropped
[http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/btgroup-privacy-and-the-net] 
the idea after a backlash from users and privacy watchdogs.

European ePrivacy and Data Protection directives require the establishment of a
regulator based in the country to make sure the interception of users'
communication is within the boundaries of the law, which the UK does not
currently have. The UK Information Commissioner has also spoken of the need for
such a body.

The commission said the UK government is not strict enough in the way it
prohibits the interception of a person's communication. ""Current UK law
authorises interception of communications not only where the persons concerned
have consented to interception but also when the person intercepting the
communications has 'reasonable grounds for believing' that consent to do so has
been given. These UK provisions do not comply with EU rules defining consent as
'freely given, specific and informed indication of a person's wishes',"" it
added.

UK law should align itself with EU directives ordering penalties to be imposed
for any unlawful interception of communication, the commission said, rather than
limiting sanctions to ""intentional"" interception, as the law currently states.

Daniel Hamilton, campaign director at privacy lobby group Big Brother Watch,
told the Guardian: ""For companies like BT to monitor the internet access habits
of their customers in order to sell targeted advertising is simply unacceptable.

""While it's humiliating that it has taken the threat of European court of
justice action to highlight the deficiencies in the UK's privacy laws, BT should
not seek to pass the buck and blame the government for its policy of snooping on
its own customers. BT must take concrete steps to ensure such intrusions into
personal privacy are not repeated in future.""","Technology","2010-10-01T13:20:17Z","UK faces EU case over online privacy","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/01/eu-online-privacy"
"technology/2011/may/25/ed-vaizey-ico-cookies","The communications minister Ed Vaizey and the Information Commissioner's Office
(ICO) have come to an uneasy truce over a new European directive affecting web
browsers which comes into force at midnight on Thursday.

The directive covers ""cookies"" – small text files that are saved on the user's
computer when they visit almost any website – and could, if interpreted
strictly, require online businesses to continually seek surfers' permission to
update their data.

Online retailers fear it would make the experience of shopping online so
unpleasant and intrusive that people will abandon UK and European sites, perhaps
in favour of US sites which do not have to comply with the EU legislation.

Presently, cookies are updated silently on the user's computer as the site takes
note of where people have visited to retain useful data for their next visit.
They are unique to the browser, but generally do not contain personally
identifying information.

The ICO, which enforces data privacy legislation in the UK, had previously
suggested the directive
[http://www.ico.gov.uk/%7E/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/advice_on_the_new_cookies_regulations.pdf] 
needed to be interpreted strictly, and is understood to have wanted to take more
rapid action. But the government was concerned at the possible effect on online
retailers and pressured it to hold off.

After months wrestling with the implications of the directive, Vaizey on
Wednesday told web businesses that ""there will be no immediate changes to how UK
websites operate as a result of new EU rules"". Instead, he says he will work
with organisations to ""come up with workable technical solutions"" before any
enforcement.

The ICO on Wednesday suggested the present delay in changes is only temporary
and that website operators have up to one year to ""get their house in order"" and
that ""this does not let everyone off the hook"".

Its own attitude was made plain when it pointedly chose not to follow the
government's advice on a phased approach, Instead from Thursday, its own website
will feature a header bar giving users information about the cookies it uses and
offering choices about how to manage them. ""In short, we are following our own
advice ... Our priority has been complying with the law from 26 May,"" it says.

But retailers, publishers and other online businesses breathed a sigh of relief
at Vaizey's statement. Lawrence Merritt, who runs Photobox, a personal
publishing platform, said Google – which provides his adverts – had told him to
""do nothing"".

The law firm Charles Russell said it was ""virtually impossible"" to set out
compliance advice on the new law. ""The advice really comes down to the cliche
answer of 'it depends',"" commented Andrew Sharpe, who notes that under the
directive as it stands, ""no cookies can now be used lawfully unless the user has
given his or her consent to their use"".

Websites had worried that they might have to secure that consent with popups or
terms and conditions pages. But the Guardian has learned that some may simply
include text somewhere on their website saying that use of it implies consent.

One problem sites are wrestling with if the ICO insists on enforcement is a
catch-22 where if people choose not to accept cookies, then sites will have to
keep asking them if they want to accept cookies – because they will not be able
to set a cookie indicating their preference. That could make online shopping and
moving between sites which can read each others' cookies – because they belong
to the same advertising network, such as Google's DoubleClick – a ""nightmare
scenario"" where the user is plagued with endless popup windows asking for their
permission to use cookies.

Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the European commission, insisted the need for
consent was real and would have to be enforced: ""We don't want to interfere too
much with the way the internet works, but data is being collected without the
knowledge of the user and being used in a way that they might not agree with,
then they need to know,"" he said.

""If a cookie is installed on a user's machine that isn't directly linked to the
service that they're currently accessing, [users] have to give their consent.""

Vaizey has previously indicated his discomfort with the rules. In a recent
speech, he called it ""a good example of a well-meaning regulation that will be
very difficult to make work in practice"".

Excluded from the new rules are cookies that are ""strictly necessary"" for a
service requested by the user. The ICO says this exception is a narrow one, but
one example might be a cookie that is used to ensure that when a shopper clicks
on ""add to basket"" or ""proceed to checkout"", the site ""remembers"" what they
chose on a previous page.","Technology","2011-05-25T16:36:34Z","Ed Vaizey and ICO come to truce over EU directive on 'cookies'","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/25/ed-vaizey-ico-cookies"
"business/2009/apr/14/phorm-privacy-data-protection-eu","The European commission has launched legal proceedings against the UK government
for alleged breach of EU data protection laws caused by controversial internet
advertising company Phorm.

Telecoms commissioner Viviane Reding said UK law will have to change to ensure
the confidentiality of communications by prohibiting interception and
surveillance without a user's consent.

The move follows months of informal communication between Brussels and the
Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) about Phorm's controversial
behaviour-targeted advertising technology. Phorm's technology enables internet
service providers (ISPs) to analyse what their users are doing to build up a
profile of their interests, which can then be used by advertisers to serve more
relevant adverts on websites they subsequently visit.

A year ago, BT admitted it had tested the technology in 2006 and 2007 without
informing customers involved in the trial. That lead to protests from privacy
campaigners and several complaints to the commission from individuals and MEPs,
which sparked the talks with the ICO.

The technology was subsequently cleared by the ICO, provided consumers were
required to opt in to it. The commission, however, believes the UK law needs to
be strengthened to ensure that UK users are asked to give their consent before
their data is intercepted.

The commission said it had written several letters to the UK authorities since
July 2008, asking how they had implemented relevant EU laws in the context of
the Phorm case. The EU directive on privacy and electronic communications
requires member states to ensure confidentiality of the communications and
related traffic data by prohibiting unlawful interception and surveillance
unless the users concerned have consented, while the EU data protection
directive specifies that user consent must be ""freely given, specific and
informed"". The directive also requires member states to establish appropriate
sanctions in case of infringement, with independent authorities charged with
supervising implementation.

""Following an analysis of the answers received, the commission has concerns that
there are structural problems"" in the way the UK has implemented these rules,
the commission said in a statement.

Under UK law, it is an offence to unlawfully intercept communications. However,
the scope of this offence is limited to ""intentional"" interception. Moreover,
according to this law, interception is also considered to be lawful when the
interceptor has ""reasonable grounds for believing"" that consent to interception
has been given.

The commission said it is concerned that the UK does not have an independent
national supervisory authority that deals with such interceptions. The Office of
Surveillance Commissioners, which oversees conduct of covert surveillance, only
looks after public authorities while the ICO, which looks after issues such as
data protection, cannot enforce the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act
(RIPA), which covers interception.

""Technologies like internet behavioural advertising can be useful for businesses
and consumers but they must be used in a way that complies with EU rules. These
rules are there to protect the privacy of citizens and must be rigorously
enforced by all member states,"" said Reding. ""We have been following the Phorm
case for some time and have concluded that there are problems in the way the UK
has implemented parts of EU rules on the confidentiality of communications.

""I call on the UK authorities to change their national laws and ensure that
national authorities are duly empowered and have proper sanctions at their
disposal to enforce EU legislation on the confidentiality of communications.
This should allow the UK to respond more vigorously to new challenges to
e-privacy and personal data protection, such as those that have arisen in the
Phorm case. It should also help reassure UK consumers about their privacy and
data protection while surfing the internet.""

The UK has two months to reply and if it does not – or if its response is deemed
inadequate – the commission may decide to issue a ""reasoned opinion"" calling for
changes to the law. If that fails to work, the UK could be taken before the
European court of justice and forced to change the law.","Business","2009-04-14T13:30:04Z","Phorm: UK faces court for failing to enforce EU privacy laws","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/14/phorm-privacy-data-protection-eu"

its citizens more than other EU countries. But now Britain might be taken to
court by the EU for failing to provide the UK citizens with enough privacy and
personal data protection. 

The EU just launched the second step of legal action to force Britain to bring
its data protection framework into line with its rules, which guarantee the
confidentiality of electronic communication such as emails and internet surfing.
Before being internationally embarrassed, the UK has two month to comply with
the detailed opinion, which was sent to the UK by the European Commission
yesterday and marks the second stage of infringement procedure. 

The EU Commission has basically identified three failings. First, there is no
independent authority supervising the interception of communications and hearing
related complaints. Second, there is an excessively wide interpretation of the
principle of consent given in Britain's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.
Third, its sanctions against the interception of personal data are too limited.

The case came up last year
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/06/bt-phorm-internet] when the
technology company Phorm planned a targeted web advertising system. This
included the tracking of their customers' internet traffic without telling them.
British MEPs protested and campaigners complained to the information
commissioner, the interception commissioner, government departments, Ofcom
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/aug/20/internet-targeted-advertising-oft-investigation] 
and the police. All refused to act. 

Government investigation concluded that Phorm
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/sep/21/phorm-results-losing-money] 
didn't breach European laws on data protection and The City of London police
announced as well, that they had found no evidence of illegal activity. So in
2008 the campaigners wrote to Viviane Reding, the EU telecoms commissioner.
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/jul/07/phorm-internet] And she
responded. 

""People's privacy and the integrity of their personal data ... is a fundamental
right, protected by European law. That is why the Commission is vigilant in
ensuring that EU rules and rights are put in place,"" she said in a statement
yesterday. 

""I therefore call on the UK authorities to change their national laws to ensure
that British citizens fully benefit from the safeguards set out in EU law
concerning confidentiality of electronic communications.""

A consolation might be that the EU Commission has also sent letters of formal
notice, the first stage of the infringement procedure, to Romania, Poland and
Germany.","Technology","2009-10-30T10:34:24Z","EU goes to next stage in privacy action against Britain","https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/oct/30/digital-media-phorm"
"business/2009/jul/06/btgroup-privacy-and-the-net","BT has quietly ditched a controversial system that tracks the internet habits of
its customers, developed by the technology firm Phorm, which has been attacked
as online snooping by privacy campaigners. BT was a key player in the
development of Phorm's Webwise system, which uses information about which sites
an internet user visits to target them with relevant advertising on subsequent
pages.

It carried out secret tests of the technology in 2006 and 2007 which are now the
basis of a European commission investigation into the UK government's failure to
protect its citizens online. Last year BT carried out a proper consumer trial of
Phorm's technology. The results have been keenly awaited, not just by management
at Phorm – whose chairman is former chancellor Norman Lamont – but by its other
two potential partners, Virgin Media and TalkTalk.

But BT has decided not to proceed with rolling out Webwise to its 4.8 million
broadband customers, dealing a heavy blow to AIM-listed Phorm. The company,
which has received complaints from customers about Phorm, said the decision was
down to its need to conserve resources as it looks to invest £1.5bn in putting a
next-generation super-fast broadband network within reach of 10 million homes by
2012. Privately, however, BT bosses have been increasingly concerned about
consumer resistance to advertising based on monitoring users' online behaviour
and specifically about the backlash against Phorm.

""We continue to believe the interest-based advertising category offers major
benefits for consumers and publishers alike,"" said a spokesman for BT. ""However,
given our public commitment to developing next-generation broadband and
television services in the UK we have decided to weigh up the balance of
resources devoted to other opportunities.

""Given these commitments, we don't have immediate plans to deploy Webwise today.
However, the interest-based advertising market is extremely dynamic and we
intend to monitor Phorm's progress …before finalising our plans.""

The news will throw the spotlight on Virgin Media and TalkTalk, which recently
snapped up rival internet service provider Tiscali. Between them, BT, Virgin
Media and TalkTalk control about three-quarters of the UK broadband market.

Virgin Media is understood to remain interested in the concept of behavioural
targeted advertising, not least for use with its video on demand service, and is
in talks with a number of potential technical partners. But the internet service
provider is understood to have cooled on the idea of using Phorm's technology.

TalkTalk, meanwhile, has said it is keeping an eye on Webwise but any
implementation would have to be done solely on an opt-in basis – customers would
not be automatically connected to the service – and the company currently has no
time–scale for deployment.

A spokesman for Phorm said BT's decision was not the end of the world, not least
because it has been expanding overseas and is now in talks with potential ISP
partners in 15 other countries. This year the company announced a trial of its
technology with KT, South Korea's largest ISP, and another overseas deal is
expected to be announced shortly.

""It is not a great surprise to us, to be honest. It has been a long process and
we have never had a definitive date on a launch,"" said a spokesman. ""Phorm is
not just dependent on a UK model with one ISP.""

But it is the latest in a series of setbacks for Phorm, which has become
something of an internet industry bete noire. Amazon recently ""opted out"" of
Webwise, saying it did not want traffic to its websites monitored by ISPs that
sign up to use the technology. Google and Bebo are also considering opting out,
potentially depriving Phorm of crucial information about internet users' tastes.

The UK government is also understood to have opted its domain names – such as
www.direct.gov.uk – out of Webwise amid concerns about privacy. Although ISPs,
media companies and even some politicians see Phorm as a way in which UK
companies can claw back some share of the internet advertising market from the
clutches of Google, the web's creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has criticised it as
unjustifiable online snooping.

• The headline on this story was amended on 7 July 2009. The original implied
that Phorm was already in use by BT.","Business","2009-07-05T23:05:48Z","BT drops Phorm targeted ad service after outcry over privacy","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/btgroup-privacy-and-the-net"
"business/2009/jul/06/online-privacy-phorm-bt","When a cross-party group of MPs sits down to hear evidence about the thorny
issue of online privacy tomorrow, there will be an uncharacteristically festive
mood among the audience of campaigners in the House of Commons. After 18 months
of sustained lobbying, they are claiming a major victory in a fierce battle with
the closest the UK internet industry has to a bogeyman – a loss-making,
AIM-listed company called Phorm. BT today admitted it has mothballed plans to
introduce the firm's technology which tracks the internet habits of customers
and has been attacked as online snooping.

The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Communications, or apComms for short, is
looking at whether the government should intervene in the murky world of
behavioural advertising services and whether new laws might be needed to protect
internet users. The debate has been pushed up the political agenda by the furore
which has surrounded Phorm, stoked up by a dedicated band of online activists
who have taken their fight to the government's own privacy adviser, the police,
and even Brussels.

Along the way there have been revelations of secret trials of online snooping
technology, vitriolic attacks by both sides and the threat of legal action
against the UK government by the European commission for its handling of the
whole issue. The involvement of former Conservative chancellor Norman Lamont, as
chairman of Phorm, and the fact that the firm's public relations head, Patrick
Robertson, used to advise Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, has added
spice to the mix.

Today, however, shareholders in Phorm were left with a decidedly sour taste in
their mouths as news of BT's U-turn, exclusively revealed by the Guardian, saw
the company's shares plunge 40%. It leaves Virgin Media and TalkTalk as the only
internet service providers (ISPs) still in the running to implement the Phorm
service, called Webwise. Virgin, however, is already understood to have gone
""cool"" on the idea of using Phorm's technology saying that it is ""reviewing
potential opportunities"" with other companies as well as Phorm. TalkTalk also
shows little desire to step into the breach abandoned by BT.

Meanwhile, online advertisers and media companies – crucial partners if a system
like Phorm is to work – have been spooked by the privacy campaign. The real
winners from the whole debacle could well end up being existing online
advertisers such as Google who already collect a lot of information about online
users and feared a wider debate into the issue.

Privacy campaigners today, however, were in a jubilant mood. Alexander Hanff,
who was one of the lead lobbyists against Phorm and now works for Privacy
International as a result of his lengthy campaign, said the battle with BT may
have been won, but the fight is by no means over. ""It has dominated my life for
the last 18 months, cost me a huge amount of money and made a huge impact on my
life so the news about BT was very, very well received, but we are now looking
at the global issue"" he said. ""The fight is not over yet: the news about BT is
very good news but we are now looking at the global issue.""

Another long-term activist, Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights
Group, said: ""There has been a groundswell in public sympathy for privacy
concerns. Legislators and regulators must take these concerns more seriously.""

The idea behind Webwise is simple – though technically difficult to implement.
It allows ISPs to get a small slice of online advertising revenues by tracking
surfers' interests from watching their online visits and then selling that
information to advertisers so they can place more relevant adverts on websites.
Phorm ""anonymises"" this information so the user cannot be identified and the
process has been cleared by the Information Commissioner's Office. Privacy
campaigners, however, object to the way in which the information is gathered.

BT also skewed the whole debate when it emerged that it had secretly tested
Webwise in 2006 and 2007. That news sparked the campaign which led to
yesterday's climbdown by BT. Phorm initially tried to counteract the criticism
of its technology through a series of public ""town hall"" meetings, before
resorting to direct personal attacks on what it termed ""privacy pirates"" through
its StopPhoul Play website.

Phorm maintained today that BT's decision is not a lethal blow as it is working
on deals with ISPs in other countries. But for the company's critics it has
certainly been a cause for celebration.","Business","2009-07-06T19:30:51Z","Campaigners claim online privacy victory","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/online-privacy-phorm-bt"
"media/2009/aug/20/internet-targeted-advertising-oft-investigation","The Office of Fair Trading is to launch an investigation into how the habits
and personal information of web users are used to target internet advertising.

Competition regulators said they had been prompted to launch the study, which
could ultimately lead to an industry code of practice, because of a need to
""update the understanding of consumer harm that arises from potentially
misleading advertising and pricing"" on the internet.

The OFT inquiry, entitled ""Advertising and Pricing market study"", will look at a
number of areas of online pricing and advertising including price comparison
websites and the use of personal data in website advertising.

""It will evaluate which advertising and pricing practices are most detrimental
to consumers, taking into account the growth of the use of the internet for
online shopping, information provision and advertising,"" said the OFT.

The OFT added that there is a strong chance that the final decision on the scope
of the study – which is calling for submissions from interested parties until 18
September – is likely to include an examination of behavioural advertising.

""We are also considering including the use of personal information in
advertising and pricing,"" said the OFT. ""In particular, we may look at
behavioural advertising where information on a consumer's online activity is
used to target the internet advertising they see. We may also examine the
practice of tailoring prices to individual consumers on the basis of their
personal data.""

Behavioural advertising has been seen as a potentially lucrative revenue
generator by companies looking to make use of web interactivity to learn more
about users' browsing habits and personal information in order to better target
ads and products. One of the most controversial companies in this sector is
Phorm.

Phorm has attracted criticism from campaigning groups and former partners such
as BT have pulled out of the service
[http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2009/jul/21/phorm].

Phorm's technology has been the subject of numerous investigations.

In September the City of London police announced that they had completed an
investigation of Phorm [
http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/30/phorm.new] and found no
evidence of illegal activity, paving the way for the new ad targeting trial to
begin.

Similarly a government investigation, by the Department for Business, Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform - now Business, Innovation and Skills - reached the
conclusion that Phorm did not breach European laws on data protection [
http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/30/phorm.new].

However, Phorm is now at the heart of European Commission infringement
proceedings against the UK for failing to uphold privacy laws in line with
European Union regulations
[http://news.softpedia.com/news/EU-Launches-Case-Against-the-UK-over-Phorm-110239.shtml]
.

The controversial company is also currently the subject of a Crown Prosecution
Service investigation into privacy breaches, although law firm Pinsent Masons
argues that the company may well be cleared in this inquiry
[http://www.out-law.com/page-9090].

Heather Clayton, senior director of the OFT's consumer market group, said: ""The
way that businesses advertise and price goods and services constantly evolves,
and we need to keep up to date on how consumers view these adverts, and the
types of advertising and prices which may mislead. Before starting our study, we
want to understand from consumer groups, businesses and other organisations
which areas they think we should focus on.""

"technology/2012/may/26/cookies-law-changed-implied-consent","New EU regulations on the use by British websites of cookies have been watered
down by the UK's information commissioner just hours before they were due to
come into force.

But they could mean that Britain is out of step with EU law in its
implementation of the continent-wide directives, and lead to fights with
European courts.

In an updated version
[http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/cookies_guidance_v3.ashx] 
of its advice for websites on how to use cookies – small text files that are
stored on the user's computer and can identify them – the Information
Commissioner's Office (ICO) has said that websites can assume that users have
consented to their use of them.

The advice was only updated on Thursday, 48 hours before the deadline for
implementing the new rules, and published the next day.

""This is a striking shift,"" said Stephen Groom, head of marketing and privacy
law at the law firm Osborne Clarke. ""Previously the ICO said that implied
consent would be unlikely to work. Now it says that implied consent is a valid
form of consent.""

The use of ""implied consent"" shifts responsibility to the user rather than the
website operator, and will come as a relief to thousands of website operators
who have been struggling to comply with new EU directives which came into law a
year ago.

Those required sites to make it clear when they were saving a cookie on the
user's computer which many sites complained was simply impractical. Sites rely
on cookies to store data such as online shopping baskets, identification and
other user preferences, and requiring users to agree to each instance would
subject them to a blizzard of decisions about acceptance or refusal.

""Just six months ago the ICO said general awareness of the functions and use of
cookies was simply not high enough for websites to look to rely entirely in the
first instance on implied consent,"" said Groom. ""Now it tells us that 'implied
consent has always been a reasonable proposition in the context of data
protection law' and that it remains so in the context of storage of information
or access to information using cookies and similar devices.""

Michael Ross, former CEO of the online retailer figleaves.com, had come out
against those proposals. ""The EU cookie law is simply a bad law and a restraint
to trade online at a time when business needs all the help it can get. Trading
online without using cookies for analytics or various types of marketing
tracking is analogous to asking a retailer to trade blindfolded. It's simply not
possible.""

According to a recent KPMG study, 95% of companies have yet to comply with the
legislation and any business implementing the law in its entirety risks going
bust, some had warned. The ICO is able to exact a fine of up to £500,000.

In May 2011 Brussels introduced amendments to the 2003 EU e-privacy directive
requiring websites to gain user consent for the use of tracking technologies,
the most common of which are 'cookies'. The guidance issued on the updated rules
encourages companies to be more open about what these cookies are and how they
might be used. In the UK, the ICO gave companies a year-long grace period to
implement these changes, which comes to an end on 26 May 2012.

Bur analysts say a number of grey areas remain. For example, a website might
sell some of its space for marketing, which is auctioned in real time to
advertisers, making it near-impossible to show users immediately which cookies
are going to be used.

UK websites had also complained that it would put them at a disadvantage against
European sites which had taken a more laissez-faire attitude to implementing the
directive. Vinod Bange, data privacy specialist at the law firm Taylor Wessing,
said: ""Given that the rest of mainland Europe is yet to take this directive
seriously, it is a shame that UK Plc's online economy is being jeopardised. If
the new cookie law were fully enforced by the ICO, it could make Europe – and
the UK specifically – a less attractive place to do business, and less
competitive globally.""

Groom noted that ""although this new, pragmatic approach is undoubtedly more
business-friendly, ideally it would have been good to have had earlier
visibility of this dramatic change. It also remains to be seen whether this puts
the UK out of step with Brussels and most other EU states.""

Non-EU businesses without assets in the region could theoretically circumvent
the directive and use cookies to provide targeted services, while EU-based
businesses doing so would risk prosecution. That would put UK online retailers
in particular at a severe disadvantage.

Japanese launch on Saturday. With barely 100,000 units making it onto the
shelves (80,000 if you believe most reports), the phrase 'onto the shelves' is
something of a misnomer: most machines were pre-ordered months ago, the rest
sliding straight into the sweaty hands of gamers who'd queued all night for the
privilege.

UK videogame magazine PSM3 [http://www.psm3mag.com/] sent reporter Joel Snape to
stand in line at the AsoBit [http://www.akibaasobit.jp/] store in Akihabara and
blog on the experience. Apparently, there was a friendly and ordered atmosphere
- some gamers bought food for their fellow queue inhabitants - home-baked
cookies were being passed round at two in the morning. Joel tells me he even
felt safe enough to grab half an hour's sleep - with £800 in his pocket and his
respectable second place in the queue up for grabs.

Elsewhere, scuffles were reported outside some shops - especially where people
in the queue were unsure of whether they'd been allocated a 20 or 60GB package.
According to a Business Week article
[http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061112_045318.htm],
several stores were unsure of how many machines would actually turn up in Sony's
delivery trucks, heightening the tension yet further. Meanwhile, the BBC reports
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6142576.stm] on how a few less committed
gamers were paying homeless people to queue for them. Although Joel saw this
happening in his queue he was unsure about how successful the tactic was - ""they
were all gone in the morning, I think maybe the shop staff moved them on...""

In the end, apparently only five launch titles were available: Resistance: Fall
of Man, Ridge Racer 7, Sega Golf Club, Gundam: Target in Sight and Genji: Days
of the Blade. While native gamers were favouring Gundam, the many western gamers
in the queues were snapping up copies of Ridge and Resistance.

Almost immediately, units began appearing back in shop windows

Warehouse (and of course of TalkTalk) quotes him agreeing to the statement that
""as far as TalkTalk is concerned, the Phorm system is never enabled until a user
explictly decides to 'opt in'.""

A PR for TalkTalk says that ""It's certainly the case that Carphone has the
policy that any of its customers who want to use Phorm have to positively
opt-in. Their belief is that customers should not get the service by default and
that reception towards these type of services is always better if customers
understand them and the benefit to them and want it - not if they found that,
without their consent, data relating to their telecoms usage - however secure
and anonymous - was being shared with others"".

So that leaves BT and Virgin Media, so far, without a clear policy - but with
the indication that they will go for an opt-out, not opt-in, policy. The
suggestion is that there's lots of money - perhaps £87m per year - in it for BT
if it gets enough people using it. But is the TalkTalk move going to torpedo
efforts to get millions of people using it?

privacy problems in profiling, retention and tracking... [but] we won't as PI
support any system that works on an opt-out basis.""

He adds: ""Any claim that PI has ""endorsed"" Phorm is incorrect. This is not
because we don't believe the Phorm technology has some benefits. It does. It's
because PI simply doesn't conduct that type of endorsement.""

He clarifies that Privacy International *as a whole* did not evaluate Phorm, but
that he and Gus Hosein, a senior fellow at PI, did under the aegis of their
privacy startup 80/20 Thinking ""assess the Phorm technology and processes"" to
provide a Privacy Impact Statement.

""We were impressed with the effort that had been put into minimising the
collection of personal information, and were particularly impressed with the
idea that such a system could be established without the need for IP's,
retention or profile building.""

""We did notify Phorm of a number of danger areas, particularly the notification
and consent conditions applied by its ISP partners, however we felt the Phorm
process itself warranted praise at a number of key levels. In comparison to,
say, the potential of the Google/Doubleclick process, Phorm deserves credit for
attempting to create a stronger privacy and anonymisation focus.""

"technology/blog/2008/apr/01/phormandbtconductedsecret","The Register has a veritable scoop
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/01/bt_phorm_2006_trial/]: 121 Media - the
company that metamorphosed into Phorm - and BT tried out their data-sniffing
systems on 18,000 customers between October 23 and November 3 2006.

The Register explains:

Documents seen by The Register show that the companies used the secret profiles
to target advertising at broadband customers when they visited certain popular
websites. 

Phorm had purchased commercial space on these websites, although their URLs are
not included in the documents. The groups targeted included people interested in
finance (for an Egg credit card campaign), weight loss (a Weight Watchers
campaign), and jobs (a Monster.com campaign). 

BT has confirmed the dates and the numbers in a statement:

BT can confirm that a small scale technical test of a prototype advertising
platform took place for two weeks during September - October 2006. The purpose
of the test was to evaluate the functional and technical performance of the
platform. It is important for BT to ensure that before any new technologies are
deployed, they are robust and fit for purpose. No personally identifiable
information was processed, stored or disclosed during this test. 

We have asked whether the 18,000 were at a single exchange, or location (say,
London or Bristol) or geographically disparate; we're awaiting a response.

The important question, which The Register raises, is: was this lawful? Under
the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, it is an offence to
intercept internet traffic without a warrant or consent. Was there a warrant or
consent here? Clearly not. The question then becomes whether this was
""interception"" in the legal definition. BT did not answer The Register on this
point; we have re-asked.

BT meanwhile still intends to move ahead with trials of the Phorm system later
this month. ""Not today though,"" said the spokesman. ""And not tomorrow either.""

trial, Stratis Scleparis was chief technology officer at BT Retail, which

"technology/blog/2008/apr/06/cambridgeresearcherlooksint","Dr Richard Clayton (Security Research, Computer Laboratory, University of
Cambridge) went to see the Phorm system and has written a paper (PDF)

On his blog, he comments
[http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2008/04/04/the-phorm-webwise-system/]:

Overall, I learnt nothing about the Phorm system that caused me to change my
view that the system performs illegal interception as defined by s1 of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. 

Phorm argue, with some justification, that their system does not permit them to
identify individuals and that they meet and exceed all necessary Data Protection
regulations -- producing a system that is superior to other advertising
platforms that profile Internet users.

Mayhap, but this is to mix up data protection and privacy.



According to the BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7331493.stm]: ""In
response to Dr Clayton's report, a spokesperson for Phorm said: ""Our technology
complies with all the appropriate UK laws - and we've consulted a range of
experts on this.""

""The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) was drafted in the earliest
days of the internet. It is not designed to criminalise legitimate business
activities - online targeted advertising is an accepted part of the internet
landscape today.""

[http://www.fipr.org/press/080423phorm.html] about the legality of Phorm's
server-side adware system, in an open letter to Jacqui Smith, the minister in
charge there.

The open letter [http://www.fipr.org/080423holetter.pdf] (PDF) follows analysis
by Richard Clayton, FIPR's treasurer (and a security expert at Cambridge
University) and by Nicholas Bohm, its general counsel. They conclude that ""the
operation of Phorm's systems involves:

 * interception of communications, an offence contrary to section 1 of the
   Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
 * fraud, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006
 * unlawful processing of sensitive personal data, contrary to the Data
   Protection Act 1998



And adds - in a just-pointing-out way - ""Individual directors and managers of
the Internet Service Providers involved could be criminally liable for these
offences.""

Well, that's jolly. And meanwhile, Dr Clayton has been analysing the
possibilities of Phorm's cookies (essential to the running of the system) being
stolen [http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2008/04/22/stealing-phorm-cookies/].

It begins thusly:

users whose ISPs deploy Phorm will end up with tracking cookies stored on their
machine, one for every website they visit, but with each containing an identical
copy of their unique Phorm tracking number. 

Next:

The Phorm system strips out these cookies when it can, but the website can
access them anyway, either by using some straightforward JavaScript to read
their value and POST it back, or by the simple expedient of embedding an https
image within their page. The Phorm system will not be able to remove the cookie
from an encrypted image request. 

Once the website has obtained the Phorm cookie value, then in countries outside
the European Union where such things are allowed (almost expected!), the unique
tracking number can be combined with any other information the website holds
about its visitor, and sold to the highest bidder, who can collate this data
with anything else they know about the holder of the tracking number. 

But surely sites know about you already?

Of course, the website can do this already with any signup information that has
been provided, but the only global tracking identifier it has is the visiting IP
address, and most consumer ISPs give users new IP addresses every few hours or
few days. In contrast, the Phorm tracking number will last until the user
decides to delete all their cookies… 

It's got to be said it's not looking too promising just at the moment. Wonder
when BT is going to be starting its trials of the latest Phorm systems? Opt-in,
of course..","Technology","2008-04-24T13:01:59Z","FIPR says Home Office 'advice' on Phorm is misleading; expert warns on cookie-stealing","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/apr/24/fiprsayshomeofficeadviceo"
"technology/blog/2008/apr/24/phormrespondstofiprhomeof","Oh, the twists and turns in the row over the legality of Phorm's server-side
adware system go on and on. Earlier today we noted that the Foundation for
Information Policy Research (FIPR) said the system infringed both Data
Protection and interception laws.

So now, Phorm has responded, and it's not pleased. It starts gently:

People are rightly concerned about online privacy and other online companies are
collecting, storing and using large amounts of personal data often keeping
personal information for at least 13 months. Our technology, however sets a new
standard - it does not store personal data. 

This is undeniably true, though FIPR's argument (and Richard Clayton's argument,
separately) is that while that might not be stored, it can be derived from the
cookies and other information flying about.

Phorm isn't finished, however:

FIPR is abusing its influence and promoting its own agenda by encouraging a
frivolous debate about the legality of a legitimate e-commerce business.
Internet users would be better served if FIPR focused on the benefits of the
online technologies available today rather than undermine the online privacy
debate and block technological progress. That would help people to make valid
informed choices about the services they want to use. 

Ooh, handbags at dawn. I don't think that Phorm and FIPR are going to see eye to
eye anytime soon.

Meanwhile, the Home Office has restated its position that Phorm is legal. Or
might be. At The Register
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/24/home_office_phorm_fipr_bt/], a
statement says that In a statement,

""We can't comment on the legal position of targeted online advertising services.
It is up for [sic] the courts to interpret the law. 

""We did prepare an informal guidance note. It should not be taken as a
definitive statement or interpretation of the law, which only the courts can
give. It wasn't, and didn't purport to be, based upon a detailed technical
examination of any particular technology."" 

This is rather as you'd expect things to be. The Home Office is not the final
arbiter of whether an action is legal; the fact that it gets told off by judges
again and again (most recently about the freezing of terror suspects' assets
[http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/24/uksecurity.terrorism]) tells you
where the real determination lies.

The upshot: everyone's still busy hating everyone. The next question: when is BT
going to test Phorm? Anyone signed up for it? (And can anyone find a decent

remain nameless.

Among the interesting points made by the latter was that Phorm has spoken at
great length to the Home Office to make sure that its scheme doesn't break RIPA
(the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act), and that it takes the privacy
issue very seriously.

Also there is some of Phorm's past incarnation as 121Media, which distributed an
adware - though F-Secure called it spyware

PeopleOnPage. (121Media became Phorm last May.)

"technology/2008/mar/06/internet.privacy","Marc Burgess has the sound of a man trying to keep a pack at bay. ""Our privacy
claims have been audited by Ernst & Young; they have been through our system and
seen that it does what we say it does,"" he says. ""Privacy International have
done a privacy impact assessment, and they will be doing spot checks. We have
spoken to the Information Commissioner's Office. All of the privacy groups in
the US, UK and Europe have been impressed by our approach.""

The problem for the senior vice-president of technology at Phorm, an Aim-listed
company which recently tied up a deal with the UK's three biggest internet
service providers - BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk, who between them have more
than 10 million customers - is that it's not the privacy groups who he really
needs to convince. It's the millions of people whose services will be affected
by Phorm's scheme, because some are up in arms over what they see as an invasion
of their privacy through Phorm's intention to categorise all of their
web-surfing habits in order to target online ads at them.

Refined cookies

The essence of the Phorm scheme is straightforward. It will have equipment at
ISPs that will track your activities on port 80 (used for the web) - though not
to secure websites. With each site you visit it will capture the URL (and, for a
search engine, the search terms too) plus enough of the header data from the
page to ""categorise"" it into one of a number of areas. Anything longer than a
three-digit number is thrown away. Your IP address is not captured, but a cookie
with a unique number is set on your browser when you start using it, which
persists into the future.

The data about what websites you tend to visit is then categorised to generate a
profile. When you then visit a page whose adverts are sourced from the Open
internet Exchange (oix.net [http://www.oix.net]) - set up by Phorm - your
browser will see adverts targeted to your profile. (Adult, gambling, political,
drugs and smoking-related adverts are not allowed.) Your browsing history is not
retained; instead the profile for the cookie is refined as it ""sees"" more of
your browsing. Sites that join OIX are told they will get a better per-click
payment than with other services. (Disclosure: The Guardian is one of a number
of media websites that are signed up to OIX.) 

Users get one benefit: if they try to access a phishing site that is listed on a
database available to Phorm, a warning will appear on the browser - though
phishing sites not on the database won't trigger any warning.

News of the deal has leaked out ahead of the service's launch. BT says it will
begin trialling soon with ""a few thousand"" customers, though the Guardian has
learnt that BT and Phorm tested the service in secret last summer; at least one
customer noticed (tinyurl.com/25jwn6 [http://www.tinyurl.com/25jwn6]) and began
worrying that his machine had been infected by a Trojan. BT's support centre had
not been told, but later said there was ""an issue"" affecting ""a small number of
users"". BT denied any involvement with Phorm at the time. The lack of candour
has now aroused the ire of many who have learnt about it, who see this as a
matter of trust - and are not convinced that ISPs are earning that trust.

Part of the anger derives from Phorm's long and chequered history. In a previous
incarnation, as 121Media, it distributed a program called PeopleOnPage, which
was classified as spyware by F-Secure (tinyurl.com/yu7pae
[http://www.tinyurl.com/yu7pae]). Burgess insists it was adware: ""Spyware is
downloaded without you knowing. Our adware client you had to deliberately
download and agree to an end-user licence agreement."" (121Media became Phorm
last May.)

But there'll be no EULA with this scheme. ""The issue is that these ISPs have
signed deals to allow a third party unfettered access to ALL of your web
browsing,"" wrote clanger9 on the Guardian's Technology blog. 

""Not just the URLs, but the content as well. The fact that they use this data to
provide 'targeted advertising' and claim to discard it afterwards is irrelevant.
All your browser content, webmail, forum postings, everything is being analysed
by servers owned and controlled by a third party.""

For many, the concept of someone seeing where you're going has uncomfortable
echoes of AOL's disastrous leak in August 2006, when it mistakenly made
available 2GB of data encompassing 20m search keywords for more than 650,000
users collected over a three-month period. Using just the clues from the
searches, which used a unique ID for each searcher, journalists and bloggers
were able to identify a number of them - demonstrating that even just your
search habits (as Google only notes what you search for and what page you then
go to) can profile you to a third party.

Phorm's challenge is that it is simultaneously trying to persuade the two sides
of the argument - the would-be advertisers and the users - of two slightly
different points. 

Advertisers are told that it will be able to profile the surfers, based on where
they have visited, and target them through that uniquely numbered cookie. But
users are told they will not be identifiable. It's the apparent contradiction in
those statements that has infuriated so many.

Millions needed

For that reason, those who have heard about it are demanding that the scheme
should be opt-in - requiring you to choose to allow it - rather than opt-out. BT
and Virgin Media told the Guardian this week that they had not yet decided on
either. But it's clear that with millions of customers, the benefits would only
accrue if millions take part - which will never happen in an opt-in scheme. 

BT, which calls the scheme ""Webwise"" (webwise.bt.com [http://www.webwise.bt.com]
), notes that you can turn off the monitoring by permanently blocking the cookie
from oix.net, though of course you won't then get Phorm's warning about phishing
sites. (Many browsers do have installable anti-phishing toolbars, however.) It
also implies that the system will be opt-out, with one question saying: ""I
didn't switch on this service. Why do I have to switch it off?"" 

To which the given answer is: ""We believe BT Webwise is an important improvement
to your online experience - giving you better protection against online fraud
and giving you more relevant advertising.""

But it's potentially an improvement for the ISPs, too - by garnering them more
money. For years they have had to sit by and watch while companies like Google,
DoubleClick (now being bought by Google), Yahoo and Microsoft have analysed
where people go online, and in the case of DoubleClick notice which adverts they
are served and which they click on. (Your browser almost certainly has a cookie
from doubleclick.net [http://www.doubleclick.net].) They've missed out on the
billions of pounds of targeted advertising those companies, and the cookies they
have placed (from which the AOL-Google data was drawn) have made. 

And with budgets getting squeezed all the time, every ISP is eager to find new
revenue sources. Phorm is understood to have contacted scores of ISPs around the
world, making presentations about the potential benefits of its scheme.

Phorm's approach, in trying to create a network from the ground up that involves
ISPs, advertisers and publishers, is certainly audacious. But one former
employee told the Guardian that this typifies its approach: ""I'm used to the
culture of smart people, long hours and overall complexity but this was
exponentially more true of Phorm. It was a 'get a Ferrari and lose your sanity'
kind of deal."" 

Adding that Phorm was ""very serious"" about anonymising data, the former employee
noted that the company has been in talks with the Home Office about whether its
system would fall under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), which
is used for surveillance and crime prevention. 

But there was also one unexplored possibility about the technology, the
ex-employee noted: ""The [Phorm] platform clearly has some edge-of-network
technologies involved. It would be entirely feasible for an ISP to allow
customers to opt out - and subsequently throttle their service.""

Targeting the grail

That would be a worrying development; but it is the simple idea that a third
party will be monitoring, even anonymously, where you go online that has spooked
people. On the Virgin forums at cableforum.co.uk [http://www.cableforum.co.uk],
95% of those who answered a poll said they would opt out of the deal.

But they, of course, are only a tiny proportion of those whose data might be
channeled through Phorm's servers. ""This is the holy grail for advertisers,""
insists Burgess. ""Privacy-friendly but targeted."" But in their quest to grab
that grail, might ISPs and Phorm have found the point at which users rebel?","Media","2008-03-06T08:14:42Z","Phorm fires privacy row for ISPs","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/06/internet.privacy"
"media/media-blog/2013/mar/05/media-owners-digital-ad-revenues","Media owners are losing control of their data and their ability to command the
maximum value for their audiences, and many don't realise it. The reason?
Advertisers and agencies are dropping cookies on publisher sites and taking
valuable data, which is changing the way digital advertising is bought and sold.

While digital media has introduced potential new revenue streams from paywalls,
subscriptions and online events, publishers all still have significant
advertising revenues that they need to retain and grow, increasingly on multiple
devices. Multiple device campaigns and fragmented audiences make it easier for
advertisers to buy in volume and drive down advertising yields.

Digital media is successfully delivering subscribers and content. Last week the
Financial Times reported that digital had overtaken print subscriptions for the
first time
[http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/25/pearson-ft-sale-digital-subscriptions?INTCMP=SRCH]
, and we can see media owners of all flavours refashioning their business models
around digital platforms. The UK advertising market was worth more than £12bn
last year, according to Zenith Optimedia. Online is already the biggest category
of spend and is on track to continue extending its lead at the expense of
traditional channels like print.

But the cookies being left on publisher sites by advertisers have opened the
door to the ascendance of ad networks, real-time bidding and Algorithm-based or
programmatic trading
[http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2165122/media-planners-programmatic-buying]
, which is changing the way digital advertising is bought. The industry is being
turned on its head so that advertisers are now the ones assigning value to
media, where volume and price dictate value rather than audience quality and
access. To borrow financial trading desk terminology, the buy side has become
the sell side [http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/buy-side-vs-sell-side/].

It's a shift in practice that urgently requires a requisite shift in thinking
from media owners, or it's no exaggeration to say that we'll end up at the
behest of advertisers who will build their own networks independently of
publishers, drive down value and make business unsustainable for media owners
dependent on advertising.

One of the problems is the currency of digital advertising, the CPM, or
advertising cost per 1,000 impressions. This encourages advertisers to buy in
volume and then expect a huge discount on the CPM. In most media, this volume
would command a premium, but ad networks, which aggregate available space from
publishers and match them with advertisers, have only exacerbated the trend
towards lower yields with publishers using them to fill remnant inventory.

Algorithm-based or programmatic trading has further emphasised the problem, with
some agencies predicting that up to 50% of bought media will traded in this way
by the end of the year. Now publishers must operate in a world where ad agencies
run trading desks that automate the buying and selling of ads and advertisers
can bid, often in real time, on ad space largely based on the value that they –
rather than the website owner – have assigned to the audience.

Publishers need to respond or yields will become unsustainable. I think the best
way forward is for publishers to act as a buyer of their own inventory. As ad
agencies increase their programmatic spend, publishers should think about how
they can increase their floor prices – perhaps they can extend their audience by
buying inventory from other publishers – just like a buyer. It could mean
looking at arbitrage – buying in one market, selling in another simultaneously
through retargeting campaigns to their known users on other sites and making a
good margin on the difference.

This response plays to the strengths of business-to-business publishers, which
have smaller highly engaged audiences that advertisers want to reach. B2B media
owners have always collected data to help demonstrate and realise this value to
their commercial partners. This first-party data can be made richer with data
from other sources, and enlightened B2B publishers are already adopting such
techniques, building their own private ad exchanges to put the value and
commercial control back in their own hands.

I believe the whole media industry can learn from the approach that B2B
publishers are taking to the way digital advertising is sold. It means thinking
about the audience and how to reach them for the best possible price, across
many devices, in a targeted way.

So publishers must think like buyers, look at what third-party cookies are being
written onto their sites and have a strategy for removing the undesirable ones.
They must work together through private exchanges and networks to deliver value
and quality to their advertising partners, and they must make sure that they
don't undervalue their business.

Yield Manager is an advertising delivery technology operated by Right Media.
Since 2007, this has operated as a subsidiary of Yahoo.

Right Media runs Yahoo's advertising exchange, allowing advertisers to buy slots
on both Yahoo-owned and independent websites that use their Yield Manager
service. Once advertising slots have been purchased, Yield Manager also delivers
these adverts on to websites.

WHAT INFORMATION DOES YAHOO TRACK?
Right Media has one of the clearest privacy policies
[http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/biz/rightmedia/details.html] out of all our
top 10 trackers, outlining what information Yield Manager records and how it
does so.

When a browser visits a site that uses Yield Manager, a cookie will be set. This
cookie is used to identify whether the browser has loaded an advert and when and
where it loaded it.

The cookie also records whether the advert was clicked on and whether the person
browsing the site bought anything.

When an advert is displayed Yield Manager also collects information such as:

- the date and time of your visit to the website.
- IP address.
- the type of browser you are using.
- the web page address you are visiting. 

Right Media says this allows it to know what type of context the advert will
appear in (the type of browser, its size and the content). It then keeps this
information in a log file for ""auditing and fraud detection purposes"".

The company also uses web beacons embedded into adverts and on advertisers' own
pages, so it can track what adverts have been clicked on and what pages that
browser then went to on the advertiser's site.

The web beacons will also be used in conjunction with cookies to note the type
of pages that a browser has been on and, as a result, provide adverts that
advertisers believe would be more targeted.

Yield Manager itself stores aggregated reports on:

- what adverts were served.
- date and time they were served.
- the websites they appeared on.
- the likelihood that they were clicked on.
- the types of browsers the advert was shown in.
- the location of the browser (inferred from the IP address).

DOES YAHOO COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
No, says its privacy policy.

DOES YAHOO SHARE DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES?
Copies of log files may be sent to advertisers, clients and certain partners
relating to the specific transactions to which they are a party, in order for
them to judge how effective an advertising campaign has been, says Right Media's
privacy policy.

Any information a Yield Manager customer collects as part of their advertising
campaigns or as an online publisher belongs to that customer.

""MALVERTISING""
Unlike some of its competitors, Right Media's privacy policy is explicit about
the work it is doing to combat ""Malvertising"" – malware or computer viruses
transmitted through fake advertisements. When these adverts are displayed on
legitimate websites (high-profile examples include The New York Times in 2009
[http://allthingsd.com/20090913/home-delivery-the-new-york-times-serves-up-some-malware/] 
and the London Stock Exchange in 2011
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12597819]), they can transfer viruses to a
user's computer.

This is not done through cookies, web beacons or any other tracking tool.
Instead, the malicious code is hosted on a web page and is loaded if an advert
is clicked on. Flash-based adverts may also have the ability to load malware
without a user clicking on them.

Malware damages the credibility of advertising networks and, as a result, Right
Media attempts to identify and remove malicious adverts from its networks.
However, it is in a cat-and-mouse game, as those that transmit malvertising go
to some effort to make the adverts they use appear legitimate.

"technology/2012/apr/24/addthis-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS ADDTHIS?
AddThis [http://www.addthis.com] is a social sharing tool that appears on a lot
of websites. It is owned and operated by Clearspring Technologies
[http://www.clearspring.com/]. 

Hooman Radfar, founder and executive chairman of Clearspring, describes the
technology as the ""largest social sharing and analytic platform on the web"",
whose goal is to ""increase traffic and social engagement"".

It is often displayed as a ""share"" button that expands to show a vast array of
sharing options. 

WHAT INFORMATION DOES ADDTHIS TRACK?
AddThis collects personal information in the form of an email address when you
request the service to share via email. AddThis uses the email address provided,
but it is not stored. The person with whom you share the site will see your
email address but otherwise it is not shared with third parties and not merged
with any non-personal information.

It also collects non-personal information in the form of web analytics, which
they share in aggregated form. Cookies and web beacons collect information but
do not track the individual user. AddThis says its servers log:

- your internet protocol (IP) address.
- browser type.
- browser language. 
- the date and time you visited that web page. 
- if you came to a web page where an AddThis Button is enabled via a search -
engine such as Google, the web search that landed you on that web page.

The servers also collect information on how often you share content with others
using the AddThis platform. In particular, AddThis logs the share options and
the subsequent numbers of clicks a shared link gets. The information collected
in this way is anonymous and aggregated

This is aggregated and analysed so that users are categorised into various
audience types. Publishers are provided with information on the type of audience
that accesses their sites and advertisers can use this information to choose
where to advertise. The cookie gives each browser on a user's computer its
audience label so that the right sharing tools and targeted ads will appear on
the sites with the AddThis plugin installed.

IS THE DATA SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES?
AddThis shares only non-personally identifiable information with the website
publishers who have the AddThis Button enabled on their websites for the purpose
of analytics. It provides statistics on sharing trends, and the top content
segments shared so that publishers can understand how users share their content
and advertisers can better target their ads.

It may share any information with third parties if it has ""a good faith belief
that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary"" to:

- satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or an enforceable
governmental request.
- enforce the applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential
violations thereof.
- detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. 
- protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Clearspring, its end
- users or the public as required or permitted by law.

It shares non-personally identifiable aggregated information with third parties
without restriction.

IS THE DATA EVER MATCHED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
The personal and non-personal information are never matched, says AddThis.

HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED BY ADDTHIS?
This information is stored for between 0 and 14 days depending on how often
cookies are flushed from the browser. It is then aggregated and analysed into
'audiences' and these categories are made available to the publishers and
advertisers.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
AddThis has variants to the information collected and terms of sharing depending
on whether you log in to its site directly or use its toolbar. 

It has an opt-out option [http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out-saved], which
drops a cookie so you would have to disable cookie blockers and not delete your
cookies to permanently have this option enabled.

Radfar says ""cookies are the ultimate anonymous experience"" whereas ""logging in
and filling in your personal details ""is far more revealing on a very personal
level.""

"technology/2012/apr/23/twitter-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS TWITTER.COM?
The prevalence of twitter.com in our data is almost certainly due to its social
buttons (""share"" or ""follow""), which feature on web pages across the internet.
These appear to use web beacons.

WHAT INFORMATION IS TWITTER.COM TRACKING?
From its privacy policy [http://twitter.com/privacy], it's not entirely clear.
The assumption is that the information Twitter can obtain from these buttons is
similar to that which can be obtained by Facebook and Google+ sharing buttons
(which are clearer about what they do in their privacy policies).

If you have an account with Twitter, you will have a cookie set on your browser
providing a unique ID. This will also record if you are signed in to Twitter or
not.

If you visit a page that uses Twitter social sharing, this cookie can be used by
the social sharing buttons to identify your account.

If you interact with a Twitter share button, twitter.com will record log data
such as your Twitter account ID, IP address, browser type, and the website you
were on. 

What is a bit unclear is how this data is used (if at all) in aggregate. It is
also unclear what happens if a browser loads Twitter sharing buttons but is not
logged in to Twitter or does not click any of the buttons.

HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED FOR?
If it's not deleted earlier, Twitter says it will delete log data – or will
anonymise it (remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full
IP address, or email address) – after 18 months.

When a Twitter account is deleted, it will remain retrievable for 30 days (in
case it was accidentally deactivated). After this, the account begins to be
deleted; this can take up to a week.

DOES TWITTER CIRCUMVENT PRIVACY ENHANCING SOFTWARE?
No, Twitter says: ""Some recent news coverage has focused on companies blocking
privacy-enhancing software or circumventing privacy settings. We intend to do
the opposite by building privacy enhancements into our products and policies.""

Twitter has publicly announced plans to update its privacy guidelines after it
was discovered in February that some iPhone applications had the ability to
download and store the entire contents of your address book

"money/2011/mar/03/which-security-concerns-flash-cookies","The European commission is being pressed to tighten up forthcoming legislation
on the use of ""flash"" cookies on computers following privacy and security
concerns over the technology.

An investigation by consumer group Which? has found that while standard cookies
– snippets of computer code downloaded to a web browser which track online
activities – can be managed and blocked, flash cookies are tougher to remove
from a computer's hard drive.

Also known as Local Shared Objects
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Shared_Object], flash cookies are a
component of the applications which run inside Adobe Flash Player. Originally
their role was to store and retrieve user preferences in order to provide a
better browsing experience. But the investigation for the latest issue of Which?
Computing found that flash cookies are increasingly being used to invisibly
track users' online habits, even when standard cookies have been removed from a
computer.

Standard cookies are a string of characters which can be used to identify a
user, but their flash cookie counterparts collect larger amounts of information
to create a detailed user profile, which is then typically sold to online
advertisers. Computer users can then unknowingly be targeted with advertisements
matching their individual interests, sometimes to an irritating degree.

Estimates suggest that online behaviourally-targeted advertising was worth
nearly £100m last year.

Sarah Kidner, editor of Which? Computing, said: ""If such practices are happening
without the user's knowledge it is pretty serious and could be in contravention
of data protection law.""

Which? is now urging the European commission to tighten up forthcoming
legislation relating to flash cookies and the e-privacy of users.

Georgina Nelson, an in-house lawyer at Which?, said: ""We believe that as the
online behavioural advertising industry innovates to collect ever more data, the
Information Commissioner's office and the European Union need to wake up and
make provision for the other tracking technologies which are being utilised to
avoid detection or removal.""

Removal of the flash cookies can be a challenge, Which? warned, and in many
cases they are being used to bring back to life standard cookies, which have
been removed from an individual's computer. The Office of Fair Trading claims
some websites are using flash cookies to restore previously deleted ordinary
cookies.

Adobe has just announced the development of a tool designed to block flash
cookies, while Microsoft said Internet Explorer 9 will include software tweaks
to prevent users from being tracked. Google and Mozilla have also announced 'do
not track' tools.","Money","2011-03-03T12:32:17Z","Which? raises security concerns over 'flash cookies'","https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/mar/03/which-security-concerns-flash-cookies"

It's probably a third-party tracking cookie, and these are widely used by
companies that serve up adverts to a number of websites. The cookie's presence
is logged on the server when you request a page. Using its server logs, the
third party can then work out which of its sites you visited, which pages you
viewed and in which order. This sort of information can track which adverts
you've seen, and perhaps influence which ones you will see later. Since this is
done without your knowledge or consent, tracking cookies can be considered
spyware. You could try to block the site by adding a line to your computer's

"business/2009/apr/15/phorm-amazon-opt-out-advertising-online-privacy","Amazon has opted out of Phorm's controversial targeted-advertising technology,
delivering a blow to the UK-listed company, which is already the subject of a
European Commission legal action against the UK government
[http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/14/phorm-privacy-data-protection-eu]
.

Phorm, which has yet to launch its service in the UK, gives website owners the
opportunity to opt out of its technology, which lets internet service providers
track where their customers are going on the net to gauge their interests and
serve them more relevant adverts.

Amazon.co.uk is the second most visited destination, after eBay.co.uk, among
shopping and classified websites in the UK, according to data from Hitwise.
Amazon's withdrawal from Phorm's Webwise system will deprive the company of
crucial information about what online users are interested in, details that
allow it to build its advertising system.

The company has removed all its domain names – including Amazon.com – from
Webwise, an Amazon spokesman confirmed today.

A spokesman for Phorm, which is listed on AIM, said that it does not comment on
individual cases. The company is understood to be planning a meeting with
Amazon's management to explain the benefits of the Webwise system.

However, this is another blow to a company whose online tracking technology has
infuriated privacy campaigners and is now worrying European Union lawmakers.

Last month the Open Rights Group, which campaigns on privacy, sent a letter to
nine of the internet's biggest names
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/02/dotcom-boycott-advertising-phorm] 
– including Amazon, Google, Bebo, Facebook and Yahoo – asking them to opt out of
Phorm's technology ""to protect your users' privacy"". Both Google and Bebo are
considering whether to opt out.

Yesterday, the European Commission launched legal proceedings against the UK
government for breaching data protection and e-privacy rules as a result of
secret testing of Phorm's technology by BT in 2006 and 2007.

The commission wants the rules covering interception of online traffic to be
tightened and the EU telecoms commissioner, Viviane Reding, made it plain that
she is becoming increasingly concerned about advertising based on the collection
of details of a user's online behaviour.

""Do you want to turn the internet into a jungle? This could happen if we cannot
control the use of our information online,"" she said. ""There is an undeniable
risk that privacy is being lost to the brave new world of intrusive
technologies.""

The sheer amount of negative press surrounding Phorm's technology has left its
creators with a major challenge. The company needs users to sign up for the
service for it to work, but a recent survey of 1,000 British internet users by
the research specialist TNS showed that there is resistance to targeted
advertising among a substantial proportion of them.

Although 47% of people liked the idea of having ads tailored to their tastes,
41% still saw targeted advertising as an abuse of their privacy. The survey
showed that 60% were happy to receive targeted adverts as long as they had given
consent.

To persuade people to sign up, Phorm is looking at the possibility of
incentives. Broadband users could be offered cheaper deals, faster speeds or
charitable donations by their ISP if they sign up.

The ISP takes a cut of the revenues from targeted advertising enabled by Phorm's
technology, which the company's chief executive, Kent Ertugrul, reckons could be
used to subsidise cheaper tariffs or even allow consumers to donate to charity.

""We are particularly excited about where we can go with this to persuade users
... to take part in the service,"" Ertugrul said last week, as he faced the
company's critics at a meeting in London.

In an open meeting last week, Ertugrul stressed again that Phorm's technology
does not produce any compilation of which sites a user has visited.

""This is a feature that takes pages and turns them into profitable opportunities
to advertisers and that is the breakthrough here,"" said Ertugrul.

Unlike search engines such as Google, Phorm does not store a user's IP address
or browsing history or log the pages they subsequently visit - known as a
clickstream.

In theory Phorm's technology is more secure than existing behavioural-targeted
advertising systems that place a temporary ID tag on a user's browser, known as
a cookie, to track what they do online.

During the meeting there was a sense of mounting frustration among Phorm's
executives that their technology has been misrepresented by some campaigners.

""The reality is that we have questions about privacy which we answer day in and
day out and I think that is more than can be said about anybody else in the
online advertising industry,"" Ertugrul said. ""I am quite shocked by the
resistance of some people to understanding some fairly straightforward concepts
in terms of what this system does.""

He again reiterated his invitation to ""the great and the good"" of the online
world to meet Phorm and run tests on its technology to test its security.

""The reality is each individual consumer will be given a choice (about using
Phorm) and if in fact we fail to convince consumers of any benefit you do not
have to worry about us, we will not be around for long.""

"technology/2012/apr/23/google-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","We saw a lot from google.com in our crowdsourced data, but there is still some
confusion as to why it might have been there. It is likely to be one of two
things: Google Analytics and Google+. Both of these also rank highly in Evidon's 
KnowYourElements [http://www.knowyourelements.com/ ] site, which lists some of
the most prolific trackers used on the web.

WHAT ARE GOOGLE ANALYTICS AND GOOGLE +1?
Google Analytics [http://www.google.com/analytics/] is a tool that can be used
by website publishers to better understand how people are using their website.
It is also used by Google to better understand the performance of its own
websites.

The Google +1 button is a social sharing tool that website owners install on
their pages to make it easier for people to share their content on the Google+
social network [https://plus.google.com/].

WHAT INFORMATION ARE THEY TRACKING?
Google Analytics
The Google Analytics cookie will store a unique identifier – so the website can
recognise you if you visit again – as well as information about the pages the
browser visits; when the browser is seen on the website; how long the browser
was seen on the website; the IP address (which can allow the Google Analytics to
infer the browser's location), and what site the browser was looking at before
arriving at the site (the referring url).

By default, this information is shown to website publishers through the Google
Analytics tools and is not shared with anyone else. It is a first-party cookie.

The website owner can, however, also opt to share analytics data with Google.
This information helps Google learn more about the advertising market and, in
return, the websites that share their data get access to tools that improve the
effectiveness of any advertising or paid search terms they buy from Google.

Website owners can also add their anonymised analytics data to a Google-owned
pool of information on sites in similar industries. If they elect to do this, 
Google will send them a benchmarking report
[http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1011397]. 

Google+
If a browser visits a website that is using Google's +1 button, a Google cookie
is set (whether or not the Google+ button is clicked). This, says Google, is the
""Google Preferences cookie"", set even if a user is not signed in to a Google
account. Its conventional use is to remember preferences associated with Google
services, such as your language and what level of Safe Search
[http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2521694&rd=1] 
you might be using.

Google say this cookie is also now being used to record when and where the +1
button is loaded in order ""to maintain and debug its systems
[http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1319578]"". This
cookie expires after about two weeks. 

IS THE DATA EVER MATCHED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
No, says Google. But, if you click a +1 button this would, of course, be linked
back to your Google+ ID. In this case Google+ will take the ID of your Google
profile (obtained from the cookie that stores your Google account ID), the URL
you +1, your IP address, and ""other browser-related information"".

Depending on your personalisation settings
[https://plus.google.com/+1/personalization?hl=en], Google+ may use this to show
other people in your circles that you have clicked that button. 

IS THE DATA SOLD OR GIVEN TO THIRD PARTIES?
Websites may share anonymised analytics data with Google and other companies
(see above). No data from Google+ is sold or given to third parties, says
Google.

"technology/2012/apr/23/doubleclick-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring","WHAT IS DOUBLECLICK?
Doubleclick is a business owned by Google that makes it money from online
advertisers and publishers. This is done by:

Ad-serving
Online publishers use Doubleclick to display adverts on their websites.

Ad delivery
Doubleclick will let advertisers control how often an ad is shown to a browser,
how long it is shown for and how often it will appear.

Behavioural targeting
This comes in two categories:

Targeting for one website owner: An online publisher can set a Doubleclick
cookie to tell them what sections of their sites you are browsing. Doubleclick
will then judge the type of adverts you might like to see from what you're
browsing. For example, if you are on a news website and you visit the sports
pages, then adverts for match tickets may be more relevant than makeup. This
information belongs to the website owner only.

Targeting in advertising networks: Google runs a service called Adsense, in
which lots of different publishers pool the information they get on browsers.
This helps them build up a better idea of the type of adverts someone might want
to see. This is a third-party advertising cookie.

WHO USES DOUBLECLICK?
Any web publishers can use Doubleclick, as long as they meet the company's terms
and conditions. Google also uses Doubleclick across its own sites.

WHAT INFORMATION IS DOUBLECLICK TRACKING?
In their privacy policy, Google explains how data is recorded from a generic
Doubleclick cookie. It looks like this:

time: 06/Aug/2008 12:01:32
ad_placement_id: 105
ad_id: 1003
userid: 0000000000000001
client_ip: 123.45.67.89
referral_url: ""http://youtube.com/categories""

This tells Doubleclick the time and date you saw an advert. It also shows:
userid: the unique ID number the cookie has given your browser
ad_id: the unique ID of the advert
ad_placement_id: the ID of where the advert was seen on the site
referral_url: what page you were on when you saw the advert

Because it records your IP address, Doubleclick can also make a good guess of
your country and town/city, too.

HOW IS THIS INFORMATION USED?
On its own, this data can tell Doubleclick how many times you have seen an ad
and, for example, whether you need to see the UK or US version. It cannot find
out any personal information about you.

If the cookie is set on an website that is part of AdSense and then you browse
another site using AdSense, the the same information will be recorded and
pooled. Over time, guesses can be made about the interests of the person using
that browser – whether they like football or ballet, for example, or if they
visit Marks & Spencers more than Tesco..

If enough browsers display similar patterns, they become part of a ""segment""
labelled something like ""football lovers"", ""fine food lovers"", ""current affairs
enthusiasts"", etc – these become labels that Doubleclick lets advertisers choose
from when they select the types of people they want to see their ads.

Once Doubleclick have an idea about the interests of the person using the
browser, they will try to use them to infer how old you are and whether you are
male or female (again, to put you in a segment).

To check what segments Doubleclick has you in, go to Google's ad preferences
manager [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb] (you don't have to be signed
in to Google).

Even if Doubleclick is used to serve adverts, Google says there are some
websites where segments won't be created: for example, health websites (where
there is a risk of building up a profile of a medical condition) and political
websites (where they might build up a picture of a political affiliation).

HOW MUCH MONEY DOES DOUBLECLICK MAKE?
Google bought DoubleClick for $3.1bn in 2008; since then its financials are
combined with other parts of Google.
Google currently generates 96% of its revenue through its advertising products.
In 2011, it saw advertising revenues of $36.5bn, with $10.4bn coming from
non-Google sites in its ad network
[http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html].

IS THE DATA SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES?
Google says it is not sold to third parties. When the service is being used by a
publisher for its own purposes (not in an ad network), the publisher owns that
data, not Doubleclick.

If data has not been sold on, has it been given to or shared free of charge with
third parties?
Not directly. However, the Doubleclick platform is a charged-for product and the
use of segments is part of the appeal for advertisers. While they are never
given information about individual browsers, they do benefit from all the data
in an aggregated form.

HOW LONG IS THE DATA STORED FOR ON THE USER'S BROWSER AND ON DOUBLECLICK'S
SERVERS?
Doubleclick cookies on the browser are set to expire after a number of years (we
have seen dates in 2014 for these). However, the override for this is clearing
cookies.
Newer cookies ""60 days in market"" and ""30 days in market"" are actually more
valuable to advertisers as they give a better indication of what the person
using that browser is interested in right now.
IP addresses are anonymised after nine months and the data in cookies is
anonymised after 18 months. At this point they are not used.

WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT DOUBLECLICK DELETES THE DATA? 
A tricky question to answer, but when it comes to the cookie on your browser,
Google says if you opt out from receiving Doubleclick cookies and visit its ad
preferences manager [https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb], it will
recognise your opt-out status.

IS THE DATA EVER MATCHED TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?
Never, says Google. This would be a breach of Doubleclick's terms and
conditions. The information obtained from the cookies is also never combined
with information that Google obtains from its other products and services. You
browsing behaviour will never be linked to your Gmail account, for example.

WHAT OTHER WAYS DOES IT TRACK?
In addition to its Doubleclick cookies, Google says that if you click on an
advert a cookie will be set on your browser. This is designed so that the
company that advertised will know if you then, after seeing an advert, went on
to buy the product [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-conversion].

CAN GOOGLE GIVE ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW TRACKING GENUINELY BENEFITS THE PEOPLE BEING
TRACKED?
The case from Google
Short-term benefits:
• Relevancy (Before cookies the web was much worse at distributing adverts that
had absolutely no relevance or interest to the people browsing. It still isn't
an exact science but they say it's hard to argue with the evidence that ads that
use targeting are more likely to be clicked on.)
• Frequency capping (Cookies can control how often a browser sees the same
advert, so browsers don't get pushed the same advert continuously.)
• Control (Unlike other forms of tracking, such as digital fingerprinting,
cookies provide ways for savvy web users to control and block particular
advertisers.)

Long-term benefit: it helps pay for the content you read on the web.

"technology/2008/sep/30/phorm.new","BT is to restart trials of a controversial internet advertising system that has
outraged privacy campaigners.

Britain's biggest internet service provider said it would begin a new trial
affecting thousands of customers starting today, despite the fact that two
earlier secret experiments involving the technology prompted outcry and a police
investigation

The system, known as Webwise, allows BT to potentially track and monitor every
website that a customer visits, allowing it to build detailed behavioural
profiles of web surfers based on their online activity.

Built by London-based advertising technology company Phorm
[http://www.phorm.com/], the system allows BT to insert its own highly targeted
advertising onto web pages to earn extra money.

While traditional internet advertising systems allow the owners of individual
websites to see who is visiting them, Phorm's systems have much wider scope
because they run in partnership with internet service providers themselves.

This means that Webwise could have access to details of every website that
customers visit, as well as every internet search they conduct and other
personal information. 

The latest experiment, which has been delayed since March because of public
concerns and a series of police and government investigations, will affect up to
10,000 users over a four-week period. 

As well worries over the potential abuse of such data, privacy campaigners were
outraged when it emerged that two previous trials had been conducted without the
consent of customers. They argued that it was illegal for BT to spy on users
without their agreement, prompting a police investigation.

But last week City of London police announced that they had completed their
investigation after finding no evidence of illegal activity, paving the way for
the new trial to begin.

Similarly, a government investigation decided that Webwise did not breach
European laws on data protection. However it did ask Phorm to allow web surfers
""to exercise choice about whether to be involved"".

But although the Information Commissioner [http://www.ico.gov.uk/], Britain's
privacy watchdog, has also warned that the WebWise system would only be legal if
it required users to opt in - rather than be applied to every single customer -
the two companies said that it could potentially be used on every one of BT's
4.5 million broadband subscribers.

""Following successful completion of this trial and an appropriate period of
analysis and planning, it is currently expected that Phorm's platform will be
rolled out across BT's network,"" they said in a joint statement.

Promotional material on BT's website describes Webwise as a fraud prevention
service, which uses its ability to track the web pages you visit to warn you if
you are visiting a dubious or fake website. It is only after explaining this
aspect of the system that the company mentions that it ""also personalises the
online advertising you see when browsing on participating websites by linking
ads to your interests"".

As well as its deal with BT, Phorm is in negotiations with other major broadband
providers, including Virgin Media and the Carphone Warehouse's Talk Talk service
– as well as some internet companies in the US.","Technology","2008-09-30T09:21:09Z","Outrage as new Phorm trial begins","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/30/phorm.new"

magazines, conferences, the whole darn show - has announced (rather quietly, to
be honest) that it will not be working with Phorm and the OIX internet
advertising exchange (set up by Phorm) for the present time.

The decision was revealed in an email to a concerned reader of the paper from
Simon Philby, the Guardian's advertising manager. As The Register notes
[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/26/guardian_phorm_uturn/], Philby said:

It is true that we have had conversations with them [Phorm] regarding their
services but we have concluded at this time that we do not want to be part of
the network. Our decision was in no small part down to the conversations we had
internally about how this product sits with the values of our company. 

I hope you appreciate that the quality of the Guardian's editorial is funded by
our advertising sales operation and it is our duty to keep abreast of all
developments in this sector. In this instance, however, I agree with you that
this is not something that we should be partnering. 

TO be clear, my information is that the Guardian had never signed anything with
Phorm; the term is, I think, an ""expression of interest"". But now it's
definitely been pushed a long way onto the back burner.

Which isn't going to reduce our interest in Phorm, of course. The question now
becomes: can it persuade enough ISPs to sign their customers up to make the
service compelling? Or is this semi-public statement from the Guardian (which as
The Register points out, remains Britain's most popular newspaper [thanks,
tribble] website) going to be a bad loss?

The stock graph [http://www.iii.co.uk/investment/detail?code=cotn:PHRM.L&it=le] 
shows that it's not doing so well (Phorm is listed on the London AIM): latest
numbers suggests it's down 2.7%. (Katie Allen has also blogged it on the Markets

Mosley successfully argued had been breached when he won £60,000 from the News
of the World, which had falsely accused him of taking part in a ""sick Nazi
orgy"".

Most of us don't have that kind of problem too often. However, anyone who uses
the internet regularly sends a great deal of data out there every day. It's an
important part of our compact with the readers that they should know how the
Guardian stores, uses and transfers the data it receives. That's why the
Guardian has updated its data privacy policy
[http://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy].

The data is important to the Guardian because it tells us a great deal about our
customers just through the details it provides. And as the privacy policy, a
link to which can be found at the foot of every page on the site, makes clear we
also use aspects of the data to increase revenues.

The types of advertising that the Guardian runs is often a cause for friction
with readers, as shown by this year's annual survey of 4,660 readers, which will
be published on our Sustainability site
[http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability]. According to the survey, 53% of
print readers oppose advertising for fashion brands that rely on cheap foreign
labour. The most disliked form of advert is for music with offensive lyrics that
includes homophobic or sexist material. Interestingly, online readers strongly
object to religious and political advertisements.

There are other ethical reasons for turning down advertisements. The Guardian
dropped advertisements for sex chatlines from The Guide nearly a decade ago.
When News International's apology was published on 16 July, the Guardian
announced it would give to charity the revenue from the advertisement (I hope to
write about phone hacking at some point in the future, but not while events are
still unfolding at the breakneck speed of recent weeks).

Advertising can be a service to readers, and the revenue is a crucial part of
the commercial model that enables the Guardian to produce its journalism. It is
important to state frankly that we need to increase those revenues on the web –
so a transparent privacy policy matters.

One of the major factors in revising our privacy guidelines has been the advent
of a new law that requires consent from a website's user before ""cookies"" can be
stored on their computer. Cookies are small text files retained by web browser
programs. Websites can read and write these files, allowing them to store things
like personalisation details or user preferences. They provide a ""memory"" for
the website, enabling it to recognise a user.

The law came into force in May, but the information commissioner has given
organisations a year to revise their privacy codes. It's been almost two years
since we released the last version of our privacy policy for theguardian.com,
and there are other reasons for changing it. The old policy required the
explicit permission of users to share data, although this wasn't required by
law. As web services have changed, the Guardian can no longer commit itself to
that.

The law – enshrined in principle eight of the Data Protection Act – states that
organisations must inform people if they wish to transfer any of their data
outside the European Economic Area. The Guardian works with third parties in the
US and India to help with digital delivery. The new policy sets out how Guardian
News & Media uses the personal data that is collected on the website, whether
provided through registration for theguardian.com or when subscribing to
Guardian News & Media services available through the site.

As well as providing information about how personal data is used, the policy
contains information on the Guardian's use of cookies and online behavioural
advertising, a method of delivering advertisements based on the type of content
that is being viewed. It also tells readers how they can select their
preferences. As before, consent will always be obtained to use personal data for
marketing purposes.

The next step will be to send details of the new guidelines to all users for
whom we have an email address; there are millions of these, so it can't be done
in one go. It is quite a task, but it will give as many readers as possible a
chance to comment on the new privacy policy.","Opinion","2011-07-24T21:30:00Z","Open door: Cookies, data sharing and privacy","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/24/open-door-cookies-data-privacy"

GOOGLE, SAFARI, AND A CLAMOUR OF COOKIE CONFUSION >> LAUREN WEINSTEIN
[HTTP://LAUREN.VORTEX.COM/ARCHIVE/000937.HTML]
Weinstein feels everyone has gotten too het up: 

My gut feeling is that we've passed beyond the era where it made sense to
concentrate on Internet privacy controls and issues mainly in terms of specific
technologies as we've done in the past. As noted above, cookies are neither good
nor bad, neither intrinsically righteous nor evil. Cookies, like the other local
storage mechanisms that have now been implemented, are merely tools. And as with
other tools, how they are used is under the control of the entities who deploy
these complex functionalities...What we really need to be concentrating on are
the fundamental issues of trust and transparency. If we as users feel confident
that individual firms are doing their best to be transparent about their
policies and are handling our data in responsible manners, then putting our
trust (and data) in the hands of those firms is a solid bet.

 Reasonable, and with useful links. But it then throws the question of who you
trust off to a hazy ""branding"" issue. Is that really helpful?

for running advertisements for illegal pharmaceutical imports. And the company
is already operating under a stringent consent decree with the FTC from the Buzz
debacle. If those weren't sufficient to convince Larry Page to put his house in
order, it's hard to know what will be. Sooner or later, the company will unleash
on the internet a piece of software written by the programmer equivalent of a
Jérôme Kerviel or a Kweku Adoboli and it won't be pretty, for the public or for
Google.

People expected that Google would have a hissyfit because telcos are
bastardizing Android instead of shipping it in the ""pure"" form offered by Google

Unlike Apple and Microsoft, their imperative isn't the purity of the
platform.... Think for a second - effectively every product Google makes is
dedicated to getting you, or keeping you, on the Internet. The Chrome browser
isn't setting speed records because Google cares about you in a deep, meaningful
way. It's to make the time you use on the web, and on your computer, so painless
and effortless that it becomes the way you always do things. Google's true
mission statement could to some degree actually be reduced down to: To become
your conduit and guide to everything, via the Internet.

A SAD STATE OF INTERNET AFFAIRS: THE JOURNAL ON GOOGLE, APPLE, AND ""PRIVACY"" >>

[HTTP://BATTELLEMEDIA.COM/ARCHIVES/2012/02/A-SAD-STATE-OF-INTERNET-AFFAIRS-THE-JOURNAL-ON-GOOGLE-APPLE-AND-PRIVACY.PHP#DISQUS_THREAD]
Battelle on Google's circumvention of Apple's blocking of third-party cookies: 

It'd be nice if the Journal wasn't so caught up in its own ""privacy scoop"" that
it paused to wonder if perhaps Apple has an agenda here as well. I'm not arguing
Google doesn't have an agenda - it clearly does. I'm as saddened as the next guy
about how Google has broken search in its relentless pursuit of beating
Facebook, among others. In this case, what Google and others have done sure
sounds wrong - if you've going to resort to tricking a browser into offering up
information designated by default as private, you need to somehow message the
user and explain what's going on. Then again, in the open web, you don't have to
- most browsers let you set cookies by default.

 Umm. Most browsers might (we'll see how that stands up) but this explicitly
went against Apple's settings for Google's benefit. The user became less
important than advertisers and Google itself. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for
the pointer.) Battelle's take (made when the story had just broken) doesn't gel
with his commenters, who have had a few hours more to digest it.

against Google
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/09/google-record-fine-ftc-safari] 
- $22.5m, which would be a lot for you or me, but amounts to about 15 hours'
operating profits based on the company's operating profits from its second
quarter - was the dissenting opinion of one of the five commissioners, J Thomas
Rosch, from the majority.

(Update: Rosch has again dissented after the FTC settled with Facebook
[http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/08/facebook.shtm] over its altering of privacy
settings. More in the piece below.)

The commissioners split 4-1 in what they thought should be the correct way to
treat Google over its behaviour. In fact, Rosch's dissent was so strong that the
other four had to write an opinion
[http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googlestatement.pdf] (PDF)
explaining their reasoning.

But first, here's Rosch's beef. In his minority opinion
[http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googleroschstatement.pdf] (PDF), he
says that he thinks that the FTC Act obliges him (and the others) 

to determine whether there is both 'reason to believe' there is liability and
whether the complaint is in the 'public interest' before we vote out any
complaint, whether it be a litigation complaint or a consent decree.

Clear enough so far? He's setting out what the ground rules are for deciding
whether to vote on something: liability and public interest.

Now it gets interesting. 

There is no question in my mind that there is ""reason to believe"" that Google is
in contempt of a prior Commission order. However, I dissent from accepting this
consent decree because it arguably cannot be concluded that the consent decree
is in the public interest when it contains a denial of liability.

That is: if Google won't agree that it is liable for what it has done, then
Rosch doesn't think it should be let off with just a fine. In fact, he's really
quite vexed (reading between the lines) at the fact that all Google does accept
about the FTC is that it has jurisdiction, and that it's doing this in the right
location: He points to the FTC Order (handing down the fine) which says ""[The]
Defendant [Google] denies any violation of the FTC Order, any and all liability
for the claims set forth in the Complaint, and all material allegations of the
Complaint save for those regarding jurisdiction and venue."" 

Yet, at the very same time, the Commission supports a civil penalty of$22.5
million against Google for that very same conduct. Condoning a denial of
liability in circumstances such as these is unprecedented.

He also points out that Google has been charged before with ""engaging in
deceptive conduct"" over Buzz, its social network which enrolled you whether or
not you really wanted to be enrolled (much the same as Google+, in fact, though
that seems to handle privacy rather better - so much better that nobody can tell
how much of anything actually goes on there). Google, says Rosch, is essentially
being charged with contempt of the FTC's Consent Order over Buzz - which is how
it got into this whole thing.

Says Rosch: 

""This scenario – violation of a consent order – makes the Commission's
acceptance of Google's denial of liability all the more inexplicable.""

He points out that $22.5m ""represents a de minimis amount of Google's profit or
revenues."" But it's even worse, he says: 

""the Commission now has allowed liability to be denied not only in this matter
but also in the Facebook settlement where Facebook simply promised to 'go and
sin no more' (unlike Google, Facebook was not previously under order). There is
nothing to prevent future respondents with fewer resources than Google and with
lower profiles than Google and Facebook from denying liability in the future
too.""

And that's the real nub of Rosch's complaint with the mamjority decision: that
if you let Google (and Facebook, which was also put under a consent order
essentially for swapping around its privacy rules so often) off without
admitting that what they did was wrong, then others will too. And if you don't 
do that, then it becomes one law for the big guys with hefty lobbying operations
[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/under-scrutiny-google-spends-record-amount-on-lobbying/]
, and one law for the small ones.

For complete clarity, I emailed the FTC on Thursday, and Commissioner Rosch's
office responded to my queries as follows: 

Commissioner Rosch doesn't think that the Commission has any business accepting
a denial of liability when 1) Google sees fit to pay over $22 million in civil
penalties; 2) Google is in clear contempt of a Commission order; and 3) there is
no limiting principle, so that the acceptance of a denial of liability in this
case represents a precedent for respondents less well-heeled and with a lower
profile than Google to also negotiate a denial of liability. Commissioner Rosch
notes that the FTC has a precedent here -- it is to allow defendants to ""neither
admit nor deny"" liability. The Commission just didn't hold Google to that
precedent in this case.

Update: in his Facebook dissenting opinion
[http://ftc.gov/os/caselist/0923184/120810facebookstmtrosch.pdf] (PDF), Rosch
says: ""I cannot find that either the ""reason to believe"" or the ""in the interest
of the public"" requirement is satisfied when, as here, there is an express
denial of the allegations set forth in the complaint."" So it's just as with
Google: Rosch feels that companies should take responsibility for their actions
(or inactions) - and wants the FTC to shift to a model like the Securities and
Exchange Commission, where if you deny the charges then you can't be part of a
consent order (essentially, getting you out of going to trial).

There's certainly evidence that within the FTC, Google isn't exactly flavour of
the month. In a call with reporters, David Vladeck, the director of the FTC's
bureau of consumer protection, pointed to other privacy screwups by Google -
Buzz, the Street View Wi-Fi data collection - and said
[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/f-t-c-fines-google-22-5-million-for-safari-privacy-violations/?ref=technology] 
""The social contract has to be that if you're going to hold on to people's most
private data, you have to do a better job of honoring your privacy commitments"".
He wasn't impressed by Google's explanation that the cookie workaround was
unintentional: ""As a regulator, it is hard to know which answer is worse: 'I
didn't know' or 'I did it deliberately'."" 

Google's statement, beyond which it's not shifting, is that ""We set the highest
standards of privacy and security for our users."" 

But if Rosch was the dissenter, why did the other four think it was OK to let
Google off without admitting liability? Here's what they say: 

Here, as in all cases, a defendant's denial of liability in a settlement
agreement has no bearing on the Commission's determination as to whether it has
reason to believe the defendant has violated the law or that a proposed
settlement will afford appropriate relief for the Commission's charges. To the
contrary, the Commission acts based on its consideration of the staff's
investigative work, and in this instance we have strong reason to believe that
Google violated its order.

In other words: denying that you killed somebody doesn't cut much ice when
you're found holding the knife still in their heart. (Or, less dramatically,
denying you ever took those cookies isn't much use when you've been photographed
on CCTV with your hand in the cookie jar.)

The key question, the commissioners say, is whether Google will now abide by the
consent order. The fine, they imply, is a big whack on the back of the hand for
Google ""when the accompanying complaint does not allege that the conduct at
issue yielded significant revenue or endured for a significant period of time.""
That's an important point, since there's absolutely no way of knowing how much
revenue - if any - Google actually derived from what it did. 

Yet simple measures of revenue aren't the key point. What's really important, as
Vladeck said, is whether we, as consumers, can trust companies with our data,
because our data is becoming all that there is of us (and if you don't believe
that, read again about how technology writer Matt Honan had his digital life
erased [http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/]

The latter being a government report confirming widespread suspicions that time
spent mucking about on Facebook is actually ""work"" you should be getting paid
for.

, the Colin and Collin Report
[http://www.redressement-productif.gouv.fr/files/rapport-fiscalite-du-numerique_2013.pdf] 
essentially classifies users of sites like Facebook and Google as unpaid
labourers. The logic being that, in using these services, you are giving away
valuable personal information, which can be used to gain revenue from targetted
advertising. It's a sort of digital prostitution ring that is making Google
around $30bn a year, including an estimated $2bn in France. In light of these
galling facts, the report concludes, France should introduce a tax on the
collection of personal data.

It's not quite right to say that internet users are giving away their
information. Access to ""free"" services like Google or Facebook relies on a value
exchange and it is your data that is being exchanged. A general haziness around
what value that data represents means most people accept this deal. After all,
would you be prepared to pay ""real money"" to fund your Google Chat habit? 
Research shows [http://mashable.com/2012/01/26/google-personal-information/] 
you're paying Google around $5,000 in personal data in exchange for its
services. Given the option to pay that $5,000 via cash, credit or cookies, I
imagine most people would plump for the cookies.

But things are changing. France's proposed data tax is unlikely to become law
any time soon but the fact that it has been mooted is indicative of a gradual
drive towards a more official quantification of data. This can already be seen
in the slew of start-ups

£1bn by 2016 in the UK alone. Now, it seems, governments are beginning to wonder
if they too can cash in.

The digital economy has often been called a new industrial revolution
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution]. And while factories dominated
the first industrial revolution, today's factory is the human body. Instead of
looking at people as ""consumers"" companies are beginning to think of them as
""producers"" emitting a steady stream of digital exhaust; indeed, the report's
authors propose that the data tax would work like a pollution tax. Some brands
have even used the idea of the body as a factory – or in Nike's case a
""sweatshop""– in their marketing activity. In a campaign called Bid Your Sweat
[http://www.adverblog.com/2012/04/26/nike-auction-bid-your-sweat/], the sports
brand created an online auction in which the only currency accepted was the
distances you'd run. Every kilometre logged on the Nike+ system was converted
into currency you could buy Nike swag with.

It's not just companies and governments that are beginning to view the
individual as a data factory: we are beginning to think about ourselves in these
terms. This is evident in the mainstreaming of the quantified self
[http://quantifiedself.com/], a movement where participants minutely measure
every aspect of their daily routine. You probably know people who own a tracking
device like a Nike Fuelband or Fitbit. And if you don't, you will soon: a press
release
[http://www.cesweb.org/News/CES-Press-Releases/CES-Press-Release.aspx?NodeID=c97f399a-44ee-4fde-83dd-abc392c9a6f2] 
from the recent International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) predicts that in
the next five years we'll see 169.5m wearable fitness devices, ""with the body
becoming an input/output device where everything can be tracked"".

The body as an ""input/output device"" is just one example of how digital
technology is creating a new sort of biological discourse. We have begun to talk
about ourselves in numerical, technological terms: the quantified self,
life-tracking, life-hacking, etc. It's a vocabulary even embraced by new-age
types who you think would be more interested in their chakras than their
computers. Deepak Chopra, for example, promoted his involvement at CES with a 
tweet [https://twitter.com/DeepakChopra/status/288307485788495874] stating: ""Our
biology is a nano-technology workshop in our awareness."" Yeah, I don't know what
that means either, except that it's probably a nano-syntactic example of
absolute bollocks.

So what is the effect of all this? Has technology altered how we view our
bodies? After all, the body as a factory seems something of a step change from
the biblical notion of the body as a temple. Or, perhaps, it's a case of plus ça
change, plus c'est la même chose. After he delivered his body/temple soundbite
to the Corinthians, St Paul went on to point out that you are not your own
property, ""you have been purchased and at a price."" With technology the reigning
religion of our day, however, it looks like Jesus might have just sold his
buying option on to Google.","Opinion","2013-01-25T16:15:01Z","Your body isn't a temple, it's a data factory emitting digital exhaust | Arwa Mahdawi","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/25/body-data-factory-digital-exhaust-data-tax"
"technology/2012/may/09/myspace-privacy-ftc-settlement","Myspace, the once-mighty social network that was ultimately toppled by Facebook,
has settled a privacy investigation
[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/05/myspace.shtm] by the powerful Federal Trade
Commission in the US over its sharing of personally identifiable information
about users with advertisers.

The company, which is trying to recover its position in the market, has agreed
to submit to FTC privacy audits over the next 20 years.

The settlement, which lays to rest charges that Myspace misrepresented its
privacy policies to users, is similar to deals the FTC struck previously with
Facebook and Google, and emphasises a new drive by the FTC to police such
policies more rigorously.

Myspace also settled FTC charges that it transgressed the EU's ""Safe Harbour""
regulations about the safeguarding of personal data collected in Europe and
transferred to the US for processing.

The next big technology name in the FTC's sights is expected to be Google, which
is understood to be under investigation for having hacked Apple's Safari browser
on iPhones and iPads
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/17/google-admits-tracking-safari-users] 
in order to set cookies that the browser would otherwise reject – which then
also led to tracking advertising cookies being set. That would be a breach of
privacy 

Because Google has ppreviously signed an FTC agreement

Google Buzz social network
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/feb/12/google-buzz-stalker-privacy-problems]
, the Safari hack could lead to fines amounting to millions of dollars. No
timetable has been given for the FTC to file a complaint against Google.

On Myspace, the FTC said on Tuesday that despite telling users it would not
share personally identifiable information with others, Myspace gave advertisers
users' ""Friend ID"" numbers.

That allowed advertisers to find users' publicly available personal information,
often including full names, and could even lead them to discover users'
web-browsing activity.

The FTC complaint [http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/1023058/120508myspacecmpt.pdf] 
(PDF) covers a period up to and including October 2010.

An example of the complaint was that although the ""Friend ID"" was effectively
encrypted after June 2010, Myspace provided the decryption key to, among others,
the Fox Audience Network, then owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation –
which, at the time, also owned Myspace. 

In the settlement, Myspace agreed not to misrepresent its privacy policies. It
also agreed to implement a comprehensive privacy program and to submit to
regular, independent privacy assessments for two decades.

Myspace, launched in 2003, was a popular online destination for years. But the
social network was beaten by Facebook as it failed to keep up with improvements
after its purchase in 2005 by News Corporation – a source of bitter regret
[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/26/myspace-rebrand-collapse] to
its former chief executive, Mike Jones.

News Corporation, which had bought Myspace for $580m (£360m) in 2005, sold it to
Specific Media last year for $35m. Specific Media, based in California, is an
online ad network operator.

In a statement, Specific Media said it settled to put any questions regarding
Myspace's pre-acquisition advertising practices behind it.

It said it had conducted a thorough review of Myspace's advertising practices
and privacy safeguards following the acquisition and had successfully improved
upon Myspace's historical practices, bringing the social media platform to the
forefront of industry best practice for ad delivery.

In November, the FTC reached a settlement with Facebook

"business/2009/jul/06/phorm-webwise-bt-internet-privacy","Shares in Phorm, the Aim-listed technology firm, have plunged after it emerged
that BT has quietly pulled plans to roll out its controversial advertising
system, which tracks the internet habits of customers and has been attacked as
online snooping by privacy campaigners.

BT was a key player in the development of Phorm's Webwise system, which uses
information about which sites an internet user visits to target them with
relevant advertising on subsequent pages. News that BT has in effect mothballed
the technology sent shares in Phorm down 40% by lunchtime today.

""The news is disappointing,"" said James Wheatcroft, analyst at Evolution
Securities. ""The UK has been persistently difficult for Phorm and this remains
the case. However, we retain our positive recommendation based on overseas
development and deployment, in particular Korea. The fundamental Phorm
proposition remains highly attractive.""

Privacy campaigners, however, have been celebrating. On the blog of Alexander
Hanff [https://nodpi.org/], one of Phorm's most vociferous critics, he wrote: ""I
read the news and 18 months' worth of emotion ran down my cheeks. I was unable
to hold back the tears of joy and even now 10 minutes later they continue to
fall.""

Jim Killock, the executive director of Open Rights Group, which has campaigned
hard against Phorm, said: ""Open Rights Group welcomes BT's decision and hopes
other UK ISPs, particularly Virgin Media and TalkTalk, will follow their lead.
This is the right decision for BT and other online providers who respect
privacy. Phorm will remain a threat to our fundamental rights while they offer
services that intercept communications without the consent of all parties.""

BT carried out secret tests of the technology in 2006 and 2007, which are now
the basis of a European commission investigation into the UK government's
failure to protect its citizens online. Last year, BT carried out a proper
consumer trial of Phorm's technology. The results have been keenly awaited, not
just by management at Phorm – whose chairman is the former chancellor Norman
Lamont – but by its other two potential partners, Virgin Media and TalkTalk.

BT has decided not to proceed with rolling out Webwise to its 4.8 million
broadband customers, dealing a heavy blow to Phorm. The company said the
decision was down to its need to conserve resources as it looks to invest £1.5bn
in putting a next-generation super-fast broadband network within reach of 10m
homes by 2012. Privately, however, BT bosses have been increasingly concerned
about consumer resistance to advertising based on monitoring users' online
behaviour and specifically about the backlash against Phorm.

""We continue to believe the interest-based advertising category offers major
benefits for consumers and publishers alike,"" said a spokesman for BT. ""However,
given our public commitment to developing next-generation broadband and
television services in the UK, we have decided to weigh up the balance of
resources devoted to other opportunities.

""Given these commitments, we don't have immediate plans to deploy Webwise.
However, the interest-based advertising market is extremely dynamic and we
intend to monitor Phorm's progress …before finalising our plans.""

The news will throw the spotlight on Virgin Media and TalkTalk, which recently
snapped up the rival internet service provider Tiscali. Between them, BT, Virgin
Media and TalkTalk control about three-quarters of the UK broadband market.

Virgin Media is understood to remain interested in the concept of behavioural
targeted advertising, not least for use with its video-on-demand service. It is
in talks with a number of potential technical partners but is understood to have
cooled on the idea of using Phorm's technology.

TalkTalk has said it is keeping an eye on Webwise but any implementation would
have to be done solely on an opt-in basis – customers would not be automatically
connected to the service – and the company has no timescale for deployment.

A spokesman for Phorm said BT's decision was not the end of the world, not least
because it has been expanding overseas and was now in talks with potential ISP
partners in 15 other countries. This year, the company announced a trial of its
technology with KT, South Korea's largest ISP, and another overseas deal is
expected to be announced shortly.

""It is not a great surprise to us, to be honest. It has been a long process and
we have never had a definitive date on a launch,"" said a spokesman. ""Phorm is
not just dependent on a UK model with one ISP.""

But it is the latest in a series of setbacks for Phorm. Amazon recently opted
out of Webwise, saying it did not want traffic to its websites monitored by ISPs
that sign up to use the technology. Google and Bebo are also considering opting
out, potentially depriving Phorm of crucial information about internet users'
tastes.

The UK government is understood to have opted its domain names – such as
www.direct.gov.uk – out of Webwise amid concerns about privacy. Although ISPs,
media companies and even some politicians see Phorm as a way for UK companies to
claw back some share of the internet advertising market from the clutches of
Google, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the web's creator, has criticised it as
unjustifiable online snooping.","Business","2009-07-06T13:09:50Z","Phorm plunges as BT mothballs targeted ads service","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/06/phorm-webwise-bt-internet-privacy"
"media/pda/2009/apr/28/phorm-startups","Phorm [http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/phorm] has, to its credit, always
tried to engage with public discussion and concern about its ad-targeting
service - but its latest move might have gone a little too far. 

The 'StopPhoulPlay [http://www.stopphoulplay.com/]' website manages to be both
rather aggressive and defensive in setting out its side side of the debate,
picking out individual campaigners and publications as ""the main characters in
the anti-Phorm campaign"" including the Open Rights Group and activist consumer 
Marcus Williamson.

It appears to be in direct retaliation against consumer-led sites like BadPhorm
[http://badphorm.co.uk]. But it really does look incredibly unprofessional.The
site has also referenced Privacy International head Simon Davies in its
introduction, which is a whole other can of worms
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/mar/25/google-street-view-privacy].

""Over the last year Phorm has been the subject of a smear campaign orchestrated
by a small but dedicated band of online 'privacy pirates' who appear very
determined to harm our company,"" explains the site.

""Their energetic blogging and letter-writing campaigns, targeted at journalists,
MPs, EU officials and regulators, distort the truth and misrepresent Phorm's
technology. We have decided to expose the smears and set out the true story, so
that you can judge the facts for yourself.""

There follows a list of recent press stories and a link that invites the reader
the 'get the facts'. But with this tone, who will trust what they have to say?

Phorm misses the point because the majority of visitors will be those who care
enough about this subject to be fully up to speed. The language is wrong, the
strategy is wrong - labelling the people Phorm need to at least engage with, if
not win over, as 'privacy pirates' and singling out individuals is extremely
counter productive. They need to build respect, and this is not the way to do
it. If they feel the criticism is unfair and unbalanced, the best way to counter
that is rational, calm debate.

Targeted advertising is critical for the future of the web, particulalrly for
advertising dependent business who need to demonstrate the power and the
commercial value of more efficient, relevant adverts. But there's a crucial
balance to be struck between privacy and commerce as these new models are
developed. Phorm made some ill-judged decisions early on but has also borne the
brunt of concern about this nascent technology that will undoubtedly benefit new
players. They have pushed the debate a little further and about what is
acceptable to the public, and that's a good thing.

But none of that means there is a future for Phorm, which will probably just
turn out to have been one chapter in a much longer story. The decision to
publish this site feels to me like a sign that Phorm is dying, and this is one
of its final throes.

Phorm is fighting back against critics with a site called 'Stop Phoul Play' [https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/4/28/1240914929897/phorm28apr2009.jpg] 
Phorm is fighting back against critics with a site called 'Stop Phoul Play' •
Also today, Phorm is under scrutiny after a Freedom of Information requests
revealed that the Home Office apparently offered 'informal guidance' to the
company on the legality of its ad-targeting service. 

Correspondence back to August 2007 shows Phorm asked the Home Office for
guidance and asking several times if it had ""no objection to the marketing and
operation of the Phorm product in the UK"". The Home Office has previously denied
providing any advice to Phorm over any possible criminal liability for the
service, but the exchange revealed by the FOI request shows the ministry asking
for Phorm's opinion on its targeted advertising guidance and how it related to
Phorm. 

A Home Office official said in an email in August 2007: ""My personal view
accords with yours, that even if it is 'interception', which I am doubtful of,
it is lawfully authorised under section 3 by virtue of the user's consent
obtained in signing up to the ISPs terms and conditions."" 

Another, in January 2008, shows an official attaching guidance notes and asking
Phorm for its opinion. The official later thanked Phorm for suggesting comments
and deletions to the Home Office's notes. 

""If we agree this,"" wrote the official, ""and this becomes our position do you
think your clients and their prospective partners will be comforted.""

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Baroness Sue Miller told the BBC
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8021661.stm] the emails made her jaw
drop, and that ""anything the Home Office now says about Phorm is completely
tainted"".

Phorm chief executive Kent Ertugrul denied any ""collusion"" between the Phorm and
the Home Office, and said the advice was ""an informed opinion on ISP-based
targeted advertising, but in the United Kingdom it is for the courts to decide
what is or is not legal, not the Home Office"".","Media","2009-04-28T10:36:52Z","Phorm: Does its stroppy campaign site signal the beginning of the end?","https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/apr/28/phorm-startups"
"business/2009/jun/10/advertising-privacy-phorm-share-placing","The targeted advertising specialist Phorm said today it had raised £15m from
investors as it continues trials of its controversial technology which allows
ISPs to track customers' internet use.

The successful share placing was a vote of confidence in a company that has yet
to generate any revenues three years after its launch.

Shares in Phorm – whose directors include former chancellor Lord Lamont and Kip
Meek, Lord Carter's telecoms lieutenant – were up 40p to 575p, valuing the
company at almost £80m.

The company said it had placed the new shares at 450p with institutional
investors and intended to use the proceeds to continue implementing its service
in Britain and Korea and ""for general working capital purposes"".

Phorm is in talks with a number of internet service providers, including BT,
TalkTalk and Virgin Media, about launching its technology, which allows ISPs to
track their customers' internet use to personalise advertising on the web pages
they subsequently visit. Phorm has now raised a total of more than £100m from
investors who are betting that its technology will transform the value of
internet advertising.

The company has provoked the wrath of privacy campaigners and prompted a
European commission legal action against the British government over secret
tests of its technology by BT in 2006 and 2007. Ministers had ruled that BT had
not breached privacy laws.

Phorm's prospects were dealt a blow when the online retailer Amazon decided to
opt out of its technology.

The company's hopes of success will also depend on getting consumers on board
and persuading them that the service is a benefit rather than a threat. Last
week the company announced a new free consumer service called Discover, which

trackers, the threat is to web privacy.

Cookies are tiny pieces of text that websites leave on your computer, so they
know who you are or where you go – most logins and online checkouts use cookies,
but so too do behavioural advertising systems.

If you’re the sort to follow EU privacy law, it may come as a surprise that the
UK is a cookie hotspot, as the information commissioner cracked down in 2012
with a law requiring consent from web users before trackers could be placed on
machines.

The UK law doesn’t ban cookies, it merely requires sites to alert visitors when
such trackers are used, which is often seen via banners at the top of a site the
first time you visit. Ironically, that means the site will drop a cookie on your
PC to make sure you don’t see the banner the next time you come back.

UK websites feature a banner or some other cookie warning
[https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2015/02/a-cookie-can-last-7984-years-according-to-new-study/]

sites place an average of 44 cookies on your first visit, well above the average
of 34 across the European countries surveyed. 

So Britons may be more likely to know what a cookie is – or in the very least to
have developed quick clicking skills to dismiss such banners – but we face more
trackers than other Europeans. 

Can we count that as a win? Asked if the ICO sees the cookie law as a success,
group manager of technology Simon Rice said it was “encouraging” that so many
British websites were informing visitors of tracker use.

If raising awareness is the goal, no one has done more to meet it than Civic UK.
It designed a “cookie control” plug-in companies could easily embed in their
websites to comply with the law, which has been downloaded hundreds of thousands
of times – and is used by the ICO’s own website.

“I think [the law] makes [users] more aware of the fact that cookies are an item
to be considered in any interaction with a web-based system, and it’s very good
for raising awareness of the risks,” said Roger Maxfield, director of Civic UK. 

USEFUL WARNINGS?
Others aren’t so sure anyone is reading the warnings. Asked if the banners
strung along the top of webpages or the popups in the corners of sites were
useful, web software development firm Silktide’s founder Oliver Emberton said
“absolutely not”.

“It’s redundant box-ticking,” he said. “Saying you use cookies doesn’t tell you
anything, it’s like saying a car uses a road. Everything uses cookies. You’d be
incredibly hard-pressed to find anything that doesn’t use cookies. The cookie
isn’t the problem, it’s what they do with the information.”

Indeed, there are other types of trackers that are more persistent, such as
locally stored objects, which do the same role but are harder to purge from PCs. 

And that subtlety has been lost as the warnings don’t differentiate between
cookies used to track or for basic page functionality, said Greg Rouchotas,
technical director at Civic UK. “They don’t have to actually think about what
cookies are or why they’re used, are they used for a specific purpose the user
or does it only benefit the organisation – all that has gone out the window.”

The idea behind the law was to protect web users from being tracked online, and
by planting a sign out front warning of cookies but continuing to overload pages
with them, developers are following the letter of the law – but that’s all.

“[Cookies are] a necessity, and you can’t do away with them, but they obviously
have been abused, especially in the marketing sphere, where you’re being tracked
no matter where you are,” Rouchotas said. “That was the spirit of the law, to
prevent that from happening.”

Tools like Ghostery let you see what cookies sites are using – including this

Emberton suggested the ICO wasn’t all that keen on enforcing its own law – and
it’s worth remembering the watchdog was forced to create it to meet an EU
directive. 

The regulator’s own stats show it’s received few reports about cookies – only 43
in the last quarter of last year, versus more than 43,000 complaints for spam
and cold callers. Because of this, and rather understandably so, for the most
part the watchdog’s enforcement has been limited to sending warning letters.

“I don’t know the people [at the ICO], but I don’t believe they have any
appetite to enforce this law,” Emberton said. “They’re obligated to make
gestures in that direction. I think they fully appreciate how completely
unworkable it is... I think there is a noble idea there somewhere, they just
dropped the ball on how they implemented it.”

Indeed, the law may run out before the cookies on your PC do: Emberton said
there’s talk in European circles that Brussels “made gestures” at the end of
last year that suggest it may overhaul the rules to make them “softer”. 

“They have suggested they’ve taken on feedback that the law was perhaps a bit of
an exaggerated response to a smaller problem than they realised, and they may
want to tone it down a bit – we’ll see,” Emberton said.

“That’s the nature of laws. You create a law and if it’s unworkable, it usually
gets kind of silently ignored for a bit until it catches up with reality. It’ll
start being policed when it starts making sense.”

SHOULD YOU CARE?
The cookie focus is rather ironic in the post-Snowden era. “The government is
telling us we need to mind the privacy of users and it looks a little bit
hypocritical,” Emberton said.

“They’re like, you’ve got to be careful about counting the number of visitors on
your site, but someone else might be spying on everything you do on your mobile
or computer.”

Indeed, with NSA surveillance, criminal hacking and all the other threats facing
people online, it may be tough to see cookies as a serious privacy invasion. 

Todd Ruback, chief privacy officer at Ghostery, pointed out that cookies aren’t
inherently evil – they’re just a way to gather information. “The overwhelming
majority of cookies don’t collect personal data such as who you are, or where
you live, but rather capture behavioural data that in the aggregate can be used
to make certain deductions about a person’s interest,” he said.

Still, users of his cookie-blocking tool (see below) seem to disagree: it’s been
downloaded 40m times, he said. “The sheer number and accelerating rate of
downloads by consumers is strong evidence that consumers care about their
digital privacy and are taking direct action to control their digital selves,
something I can get behind.”

Despite the mixed messages of the existing law – and small number of reports to
the ICO about them – cookies are a concern, countered Cooper Quintin, staff
technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

“Even if you aren’t worried about NSA spying, these third-party trackers are
building up databases with an incredible [amount of] information about you and
your browsing habits,” he said.

“This could include things that are potentially very private or embarrassing …
like private medical information, sexual preferences, or controversial opinions.
People should have the right to keep their reading habits private if they so
choose.” And if that’s not bad enough, security agencies such as the NSA are 
using cookies

Check your browser preferences. HOW TO DEAL WITH COOKIES
There’s three ways to address cookies and other trackers. First, you can flip a
switch in your browser to tell advertising networks not to follow you – this is
the “Do Not Track” system.

 To turn it on in Chrome, head to Settings, scroll down to Advanced Settings,
and tick the appropriate box under Privacy. In Safari on Macs or iOS devices, go
to Preferences, and then Privacy. Do Not Track is on by default in Mozilla’s
Firefox, but you can check by going to Tools, Options and then Privacy.

Internet Explorer has an extra step: go to Settings and Privacy, then click
Tracking Protection and click to Add Tracking Protection Lists – you’ll have to
choose which one you want to install. 

You can also register with the Internet Advertising Bureau UK to ask behavioural
advertisers not to track you – sort of like a do-not-call list for the internet.
To do so, go to Your Online Choices
[http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices]. 

Both tactics are very simple and give you a base level of protection, but the
main flaw is Do Not Track and the IABUK system are merely polite requests –
there’s no mechanism to block cookies from being dropped on your device by a
site that chooses to ignore either.

Indeed, the ICO’s Simon Rice noted that browser controls only blocked about 70%
of cookies. “While this is encouraging, this result still shows that people
can’t rely solely on browser settings to ensure no non-essential cookies are
placed on their device,” he added. 

For that reason, there’s add-ons and extensions. These are tools or widgets you
can install, normally for free, into your browser to take a harder line against
trackers. Ghostery [https://www.ghostery.com/en/], for example, will show you
what cookies or trackers are on each page, what they do, and let you quickly
block them; similar options include Disconnect and Adblock Plus.

Ghostery’s breakdown by purpose is handy, as it means you can block tracking
beacons but still let websites – such as the Guardian – capture analytics or
embed widgets, such as to display Twitter feeds. 

“We find that most people who take action actually do so with particular
companies and not at a global level, more proof that consumers want education so
they can make an informed decision that is best for themselves,” said Ruback.

The EFF didn’t think the existing third-party blockers were good enough, and its
version, dubbed Privacy Badger [https://www.eff.org/privacybadger], “is focused
specifically on blocking things that are non-consensual”. Available for Chrome
and Firefox, it blocks trackers by default, or lets you approve them one by one.

“The other thing that makes [Privacy Badger] different is that it determines
what is a tracker by watching the behaviour of third party domains as you
browse, instead of using a black list like most other add-ons,” said Copper.
“This lets Privacy Badger be more nimble and respond to new trackers more
quickly.”
